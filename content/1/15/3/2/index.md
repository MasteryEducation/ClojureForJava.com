## 15.3.2 Using `test.check`

As experienced Java developers, you're likely familiar with unit testing frameworks such as JUnit, which focus on example-based testing. In contrast, **property-based testing** is a powerful paradigm that allows you to define general properties that your code should satisfy, and then automatically generate a wide range of test cases to verify those properties. Clojure's `test.check` library is a robust tool for implementing property-based testing, enabling you to test your code more thoroughly and uncover edge cases that example-based tests might miss.

### Understanding Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing shifts the focus from specific test cases to general properties of the code. Instead of writing individual tests for each scenario, you define properties that should hold true for a wide range of inputs. The testing framework then generates numerous random inputs to validate these properties.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Properties**: Assertions about the behavior of your code that should hold true for all inputs.
- **Generators**: Functions that produce random test data to be used in testing properties.

### Getting Started with `test.check`

To begin using `test.check`, you'll need to add it to your Clojure project. If you're using Leiningen, add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/test.check "1.1.0"]]
```

### Defining Generators

Generators are at the heart of property-based testing. They produce random data that is used to test the properties of your code. `test.check` provides a variety of built-in generators, and you can also create custom generators to suit your needs.

#### Built-in Generators

`test.check` includes a range of built-in generators for common data types:

- **Integers**: `gen/int`
- **Booleans**: `gen/boolean`
- **Strings**: `gen/string`
- **Collections**: `gen/vector`, `gen/list`, `gen/map`

Here's a simple example of using a generator to produce random integers:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check.generators :as gen])

(def int-gen (gen/int))
```

#### Custom Generators

You can create custom generators using the `gen/fmap` and `gen/bind` functions to transform existing generators. For example, to create a generator that produces even integers, you can use:

```clojure
(def even-int-gen
  (gen/fmap #(* 2 %) (gen/int)))
```

### Defining Properties

Properties are the core of property-based testing. They describe the expected behavior of your code for a wide range of inputs. In `test.check`, properties are defined using the `prop/for-all` macro.

#### Example: Testing a Simple Function

Let's consider a simple function that reverses a list. We want to test the property that reversing a list twice should yield the original list:

```clojure
(defn reverse-twice [lst]
  (reverse (reverse lst)))

(require '[clojure.test.check.properties :as prop])

(def reverse-twice-property
  (prop/for-all [lst (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (= lst (reverse-twice lst))))
```

### Running Property-Based Tests

To run property-based tests, use the `clojure.test.check/quick-check` function, which takes a property and the number of tests to run:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check :as tc])

(tc/quick-check 100 reverse-twice-property)
```

This will run the property 100 times with different random inputs. If a failure is found, `test.check` will attempt to shrink the input to find the smallest failing case.

### Comparing with Java

In Java, property-based testing can be achieved using libraries like [JUnit-Quickcheck](https://pholser.github.io/junit-quickcheck/). However, Clojure's `test.check` offers a more seamless integration with functional programming paradigms, allowing for more expressive and concise test definitions.

#### Java Example

Here's a similar test in Java using JUnit-Quickcheck:

```java
import com.pholser.junit.quickcheck.Property;
import com.pholser.junit.quickcheck.runner.JUnitQuickcheck;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(JUnitQuickcheck.class)
public class ReverseTest {
    @Property
    public void reverseTwice(int[] array) {
        assertArrayEquals(array, reverse(reverse(array)));
    }

    private int[] reverse(int[] array) {
        int[] reversed = new int[array.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            reversed[i] = array[array.length - 1 - i];
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
```

### Advanced Features of `test.check`

#### Shrinking

Shrinking is the process of reducing a failing test case to its simplest form. `test.check` automatically attempts to shrink inputs when a property fails, helping you identify the root cause of the failure.

#### Composing Generators

You can compose generators to create complex data structures. For example, to generate a map with string keys and integer values:

```clojure
(def map-gen
  (gen/map gen/string gen/int))
```

#### Conditional Properties

You can use the `prop/for-all` macro to define conditional properties, which only apply to certain inputs:

```clojure
(def conditional-property
  (prop/for-all [x gen/int]
    (when (pos? x)
      (> (* x x) x))))
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following exercises to deepen your understanding of `test.check`:

1. **Modify the `reverse-twice` property** to test a different function, such as sorting a list.
2. **Create a custom generator** for generating valid email addresses and test a property of an email validation function.
3. **Explore shrinking** by intentionally introducing a bug in the `reverse-twice` function and observing how `test.check` shrinks the failing input.
