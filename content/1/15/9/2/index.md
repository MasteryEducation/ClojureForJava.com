## 15.9.2 Analyzing Quality Metrics

As experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding and analyzing quality metrics is crucial for maintaining high standards in your codebase. This section will guide you through key quality metrics such as cyclomatic complexity and code smells, and introduce you to tools like `eastwood` and `kibit` that can help you analyze and improve your Clojure code quality.

### Understanding Quality Metrics

Quality metrics are essential for assessing the maintainability, readability, and overall quality of your code. They provide insights into potential problem areas and help you make informed decisions about refactoring and improving your codebase.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity is a metric used to measure the complexity of a program. It is calculated based on the number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code. In simpler terms, it reflects the number of decision points in a program, such as `if` statements, loops, and case statements.

**Why Cyclomatic Complexity Matters:**

- **Maintainability:** High cyclomatic complexity can make code difficult to understand and maintain.
- **Testability:** Code with high complexity often requires more test cases to achieve adequate coverage.
- **Readability:** Complex code can be harder for developers to read and comprehend.

**Calculating Cyclomatic Complexity:**

In Clojure, cyclomatic complexity can be calculated similarly to Java, but with a focus on functional constructs. Consider the following Clojure function:

```clojure
(defn calculate-discount [price customer-type]
  (cond
    (= customer-type :vip) (* price 0.8)
    (= customer-type :regular) (* price 0.9)
    :else price))
```

This function has a cyclomatic complexity of 3, as there are three decision points: one for each condition in the `cond` expression.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Modify the function to add more customer types and observe how the cyclomatic complexity changes.
- Experiment with different functional constructs like `case` or `if` to see their impact on complexity.

#### Code Smells

Code smells are indicators of potential issues in your code that may hinder its readability, maintainability, or performance. They are not bugs but rather symptoms of deeper problems in the code structure.

**Common Code Smells in Clojure:**

- **Long Functions:** Functions that do too much can be hard to understand and test.
- **Duplicated Code:** Repeated code blocks can lead to maintenance challenges.
- **Complex Conditionals:** Nested or overly complex conditionals can reduce readability.

**Example of a Code Smell:**

```clojure
(defn process-order [order]
  (let [total (calculate-total order)
        discount (if (= (:customer-type order) :vip)
                   (* total 0.2)
                   (if (= (:customer-type order) :regular)
                     (* total 0.1)
                     0))]
    (- total discount)))
```

This function has a code smell due to the nested `if` statements, which can be refactored for clarity.

**Refactored Version:**

```clojure
(defn process-order [order]
  (let [total (calculate-total order)
        discount-rate (case (:customer-type order)
                        :vip 0.2
                        :regular 0.1
                        0)]
    (- total (* total discount-rate))))
```

**Try It Yourself:**

- Identify code smells in your existing Clojure projects and refactor them for improved readability.
- Use `case` or `cond` to simplify complex conditionals.

### Tools for Analyzing Code Quality

Clojure offers several tools to help you analyze and improve code quality. Two popular tools are `eastwood` and `kibit`.

#### Eastwood

Eastwood is a Clojure linting tool that helps identify potential issues in your code. It checks for common mistakes, code smells, and potential bugs.

**Using Eastwood:**

To use Eastwood, add it to your project dependencies and run it from the command line:

```clojure
;; Add to your project.clj
:plugins [[jonase/eastwood "0.3.5"]]

;; Run Eastwood
lein eastwood
```

Eastwood will analyze your code and provide warnings and suggestions for improvement.

**Example Output:**

```
== Linting src/my_project/core.clj ==
src/my_project/core.clj:12:3: unused-ret-vals: Return value of (println ...) is discarded.
src/my_project/core.clj:20:1: constant-test: Test expression is always logical true or always logical false.
```

**Try It Yourself:**

- Run Eastwood on your Clojure projects and address the warnings it generates.
- Experiment with different code styles to see how Eastwood responds.

#### Kibit

Kibit is a static code analyzer that suggests idiomatic Clojure code improvements. It helps you write more concise and idiomatic Clojure code.

**Using Kibit:**

To use Kibit, add it to your project dependencies and run it from the command line:

```clojure
;; Add to your project.clj
:plugins [[lein-kibit "0.1.8"]]

;; Run Kibit
lein kibit
```

Kibit will analyze your code and suggest improvements.

**Example Output:**

```
At src/my_project/core.clj:15:
Consider using:
  (when-not condition
    (do-something))
instead of:
  (if (not condition)
    (do-something))
```

**Try It Yourself:**

- Run Kibit on your Clojure code and apply its suggestions.
- Compare the before and after versions of your code to understand the improvements.

### Comparing Clojure and Java Quality Metrics

While Clojure and Java share some quality metrics, their approaches to code quality can differ due to their paradigms.

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**

- **Java:** Often involves complex class hierarchies and imperative constructs.
- **Clojure:** Focuses on functional constructs, which can reduce complexity through higher-order functions and immutability.

**Code Smells:**

- **Java:** Common smells include long methods, large classes, and excessive use of inheritance.
- **Clojure:** Smells often relate to complex conditionals, nested functions, and lack of idiomatic constructs.

**Tooling:**

- **Java:** Tools like SonarQube and Checkstyle are popular for analyzing Java code quality.
- **Clojure:** Eastwood and Kibit provide similar functionality tailored to Clojure's functional paradigm.

### Visualizing Quality Metrics

Visualizing quality metrics can help you understand your codebase's health and identify areas for improvement. Let's explore some diagrams that illustrate these concepts.

#### Cyclomatic Complexity Flowchart

```mermaid

    D -->|True| E[Action 2]
    D -->|False| F[Action 3]
    C --> G[End]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

*This flowchart represents a simple decision-making process with two conditions, illustrating how cyclomatic complexity is calculated.*
