## 15.8.2 Automating Tests and Builds

In the world of software development, automation is a key factor in ensuring efficiency, reliability, and speed. Automating tests and builds is an essential part of the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process. This section will guide you through setting up CI pipelines to automate the running of tests, code quality checks, and building artifacts for Clojure projects.

### Introduction to CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that enable teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. CI involves automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository, while CD extends this by automating the deployment of code to production environments.

**Key Benefits of CI/CD:**

- **Early Detection of Bugs:** Automated tests run with every code change, catching issues early in the development cycle.
- **Faster Release Cycles:** Automation reduces manual intervention, speeding up the release process.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Consistent testing and code quality checks ensure a high standard of code.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** CI/CD encourages frequent commits and collaboration among team members.

### Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline for Clojure

To automate tests and builds in a Clojure project, we need to set up a CI/CD pipeline. This involves selecting a CI/CD tool, configuring it to run tests, perform code quality checks, and build artifacts.

#### Choosing a CI/CD Tool

Several CI/CD tools are available, each with its own strengths. Popular choices include:

- **Jenkins:** An open-source automation server with a rich ecosystem of plugins.
- **GitHub Actions:** Integrated with GitHub, it provides a seamless experience for projects hosted on GitHub.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Offers powerful CI/CD features integrated with GitLab repositories.
- **CircleCI:** Known for its ease of use and scalability.
- **Travis CI:** Popular for open-source projects with a straightforward configuration.

For this guide, we'll focus on GitHub Actions due to its integration with GitHub and ease of use for Clojure projects.

#### Configuring GitHub Actions for Clojure

GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository. Let's set up a basic CI pipeline for a Clojure project.

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**

   If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for your Clojure project.

2. **Add a Workflow File:**

   In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory and add a YAML file, e.g., `ci.yml`.

3. **Define the Workflow:**

   Here's a sample workflow configuration for a Clojure project:

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up JDK 11
         uses: actions/setup-java@v2
         with:
           java-version: '11'

       - name: Install Clojure CLI
         run: |
           curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh
           chmod +x linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh
           sudo ./linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh

       - name: Run tests
         run: clojure -M:test
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   - **Triggering Events:** The workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
   - **Job Definition:** The `build` job runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.
   - **Steps:**
     - **Checkout Code:** Uses the `actions/checkout` action to clone the repository.
     - **Set Up JDK:** Uses `actions/setup-java` to install JDK 11, which is required for Clojure.
     - **Install Clojure CLI:** Downloads and installs the Clojure CLI tools.
     - **Run Tests:** Executes the test suite using the `clojure` command.

#### Automating Code Quality Checks

In addition to running tests, it's important to automate code quality checks. This can be done using linters and static analysis tools.

**Clojure Linting Tools:**

- **clj-kondo:** A linter for Clojure that checks for potential errors and code style issues.
- **Eastwood:** A Clojure lint tool that provides warnings for potential problems in your code.

**Integrating clj-kondo with GitHub Actions:**

Add a step to your workflow to run `clj-kondo`:

```yaml
- name: Run clj-kondo
  run: clj-kondo --lint src
```

This step will analyze the source code in the `src` directory and report any issues.

#### Building Artifacts

Building artifacts is a crucial step in preparing your application for deployment. In Clojure, this often involves creating a JAR file.

**Using Leiningen for Builds:**

Leiningen is a popular build tool for Clojure projects. Here's how you can configure it to build a JAR:

1. **Add a `project.clj` File:**

   Ensure your project has a `project.clj` file with the necessary configurations.

   ```clojure
   (defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :description "A sample Clojure application"
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]]
     :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
     :target-path "target/%s"
     :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
   ```

2. **Build the JAR:**

   Add a step to your GitHub Actions workflow to build the JAR:

   ```yaml
   - name: Build JAR
     run: lein uberjar
   ```

   This command will create an uberjar, a standalone JAR that includes all dependencies.

### Comparing with Java CI/CD Practices

Java developers may be familiar with tools like Maven or Gradle for builds and testing. Clojure's Leiningen serves a similar purpose but is tailored for Clojure's ecosystem.

**Key Differences:**

- **Configuration:** Clojure uses `project.clj` for configuration, while Java projects often use `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle).
- **Dependency Management:** Leiningen handles dependencies in a way similar to Maven, but with a syntax more aligned with Clojure's Lisp roots.
- **Build Artifacts:** Both ecosystems support building JAR files, but Clojure's uberjar simplifies deployment by bundling all dependencies.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided GitHub Actions workflow by making the following modifications:

- **Add a Code Coverage Tool:** Integrate a tool like `cloverage` to measure test coverage.
- **Deploy Artifacts:** Extend the workflow to deploy the built JAR to a cloud service or artifact repository.
- **Parallelize Jobs:** Configure the workflow to run tests and builds in parallel to reduce execution time.

### Diagram: CI/CD Workflow for Clojure Projects

Below is a diagram illustrating the CI/CD workflow for a Clojure project using GitHub Actions.

```mermaid

- **Deploy Artifacts:** Moves the built artifacts to a deployment target.

### Exercises

1. **Integrate a New CI/CD Tool:**
   - Choose a different CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, CircleCI) and configure it for your Clojure project.

2. **Enhance the Workflow:**
   - Add additional steps to the GitHub Actions workflow, such as security scans or performance tests.

3. **Create a Custom Linter Rule:**
   - Use `clj-kondo` to create a custom linting rule specific to your project's coding standards.

### Key Takeaways

- **Automation is Key:** Automating tests and builds is crucial for maintaining code quality and accelerating development cycles.
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions provides a powerful and flexible platform for automating Clojure projects.
