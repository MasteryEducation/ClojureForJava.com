## 15.8.1 Setting Up Continuous Integration (CI)

In today's fast-paced software development environment, **Continuous Integration (CI)** is a crucial practice that enables teams to deliver high-quality software efficiently. For Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding and implementing CI can significantly enhance your development workflow. In this section, we will explore the benefits of CI, how to set up automated builds and tests, and how to leverage popular CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions.

### Understanding Continuous Integration (CI)

**Continuous Integration** is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository, ideally several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and test process, allowing teams to detect problems early.

#### Benefits of Continuous Integration

- **Early Detection of Errors**: CI helps identify integration issues early, reducing the time and effort required to fix them.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automated testing ensures that code changes do not introduce new bugs.
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers receive immediate feedback on their code, enabling quicker iterations.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: CI fosters a culture of collaboration, as developers work together to maintain a stable codebase.

### Setting Up CI for Clojure Projects

To set up CI for a Clojure project, we need to automate the build and test processes. This involves configuring a CI server to monitor the code repository for changes and execute predefined tasks whenever changes are detected.

#### Choosing a CI Tool

Several CI tools are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Let's explore three popular options: Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions.

#### Jenkins

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that is highly customizable and widely used in the industry. It supports a wide range of plugins, making it suitable for complex CI/CD pipelines.

##### Setting Up Jenkins

1. **Install Jenkins**: Download and install Jenkins from the [official website](https://www.jenkins.io/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Configure Jenkins**: Once installed, access Jenkins through your web browser. Set up the initial configuration, including creating an admin user.

3. **Install Plugins**: Jenkins relies on plugins to integrate with various tools. Install the necessary plugins for Git, Clojure, and any other tools you plan to use.

4. **Create a New Job**: In Jenkins, a job represents a task or a set of tasks. Create a new job for your Clojure project.

5. **Configure the Job**: Define the source code repository, build triggers, and build steps. For a Clojure project, you might use Leiningen or tools.deps to build and test your code.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/clojure-project.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'lein test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: The above Jenkinsfile uses a simple pipeline to check out the code and run tests using Leiningen.

#### Travis CI

**Travis CI** is a cloud-based CI service that integrates seamlessly with GitHub. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use.

##### Setting Up Travis CI

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and link it to your GitHub account.

2. **Enable Repository**: Enable Travis CI for your Clojure project repository.

3. **Create a `.travis.yml` File**: This file defines the build configuration for your project.

```yaml
language: clojure
script:
  - lein test
```

> **Note**: The `.travis.yml` file specifies the language and the script to run. In this case, it runs `lein test` to execute the tests.

4. **Push Changes**: Commit and push the `.travis.yml` file to your repository. Travis CI will automatically detect the file and start building your project.

#### GitHub Actions

**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD service integrated directly into GitHub, allowing you to automate workflows directly from your repository.

##### Setting Up GitHub Actions

1. **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to define your CI workflow.

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: '11'
    - name: Build with Leiningen
      run: lein test
```

> **Note**: This workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, sets up JDK 11, and runs tests using Leiningen.

2. **Commit and Push**: Add, commit, and push the workflow file to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow.

### Best Practices for CI in Clojure Projects

- **Keep Builds Fast**: Optimize your build process to ensure quick feedback.
- **Run Tests in Parallel**: Use parallel execution to speed up test runs.
- **Use Caching**: Cache dependencies to reduce build times.
- **Monitor Build Health**: Regularly check the status of your CI builds and address failures promptly.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with setting up CI for a sample Clojure project. Try modifying the build scripts to include additional tasks, such as code linting or deployment steps. Explore the documentation for each CI tool to discover advanced features and configurations.

### Conclusion

Setting up Continuous Integration for your Clojure projects can significantly improve your development workflow, ensuring that your code is always in a releasable state. By leveraging tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions, you can automate the build and test processes, allowing you to focus on writing high-quality code.
