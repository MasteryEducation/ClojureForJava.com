## 11.5.3 Case Studies of Pattern Transformation

In this section, we will explore how traditional design patterns in Java can be transformed into functional equivalents in Clojure. This transformation not only simplifies the code but also leverages Clojure's strengths in immutability and concurrency. We'll walk through several case studies, highlighting the refactoring process and the benefits gained from adopting a functional approach.

### Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. In Java, these patterns often rely on object-oriented principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. However, Clojure's functional paradigm offers alternative approaches that can lead to more concise and maintainable code.

### Case Study 1: The Singleton Pattern

#### Java Implementation

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Here's a typical implementation in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Transformation

In Clojure, we can achieve the same effect using an atom, which provides a thread-safe way to manage state:

```clojure
(defonce singleton-instance (atom nil))

(defn get-singleton []
  (when (nil? @singleton-instance)
    (reset! singleton-instance {}))
  @singleton-instance)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Immutability**: The use of `atom` ensures that state changes are controlled and thread-safe.
- **Simplicity**: The code is more concise and leverages Clojure's built-in concurrency primitives.

### Case Study 2: The Observer Pattern

#### Java Implementation

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified. Here's a Java example:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Transformation

In Clojure, we can use functions and immutable data structures to achieve the same behavior:

```clojure
(defn create-subject []
  (atom {:observers []}))

(defn add-observer [subject observer]
  (swap! subject update :observers conj observer))

(defn notify-observers [subject message]
  (doseq [observer (:observers @subject)]
    (observer message)))
```

**Benefits:**

- **Functional Approach**: Observers are simply functions, making the pattern more flexible and easier to test.
- **Immutable Data**: The use of atoms and immutable data structures ensures thread safety and simplifies state management.

### Case Study 3: The Strategy Pattern

#### Java Implementation

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Here's a Java example:

```java
interface Strategy {
    int execute(int a, int b);
}

class AddStrategy implements Strategy {
    public int execute(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class Context {
    private Strategy strategy;

    public Context(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public int executeStrategy(int a, int b) {
        return strategy.execute(a, b);
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Transformation

In Clojure, we can use higher-order functions to achieve the same effect:

```clojure
(defn add-strategy [a b]
  (+ a b))

(defn execute-strategy [strategy a b]
  (strategy a b))

;; Usage
(execute-strategy add-strategy 5 3) ; => 8
```

**Benefits:**

- **Higher-Order Functions**: Strategies are functions, allowing for greater flexibility and composability.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: The pattern is implemented with fewer lines of code, enhancing readability.

### Case Study 4: The Command Pattern

#### Java Implementation

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. Here's a Java example:

```java
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}

class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Transformation

In Clojure, we can use functions to represent commands:

```clojure
(defn light-on-command [light]
  (fn [] (println "Light is on")))

(defn remote-control [command]
  (command))

;; Usage
(def light-command (light-on-command "Living Room Light"))
(remote-control light-command)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Function as Command**: Commands are functions, simplifying the pattern and making it more flexible.
- **Conciseness**: The pattern is implemented with minimal code, focusing on functionality.

### Case Study 5: The Factory Pattern

#### Java Implementation

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Here's a Java example:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equals("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Transformation

In Clojure, we can use maps and functions to achieve a similar effect:

```clojure
(defn draw-circle []
  (println "Drawing Circle"))

(def shape-factory
  {"CIRCLE" draw-circle})

(defn get-shape [shape-type]
  (get shape-factory shape-type))

;; Usage
((get-shape "CIRCLE"))
```

**Benefits:**

- **Data-Driven Design**: The use of maps allows for easy extension and modification of the factory.
- **Simplicity**: The pattern is implemented with fewer lines of code, enhancing maintainability.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored these transformations, try modifying the Clojure code examples to implement additional features or patterns. For instance, you could:

- Extend the `Observer` pattern to include filtering of notifications based on certain criteria.
- Implement a `Strategy` pattern that supports multiple operations like subtraction or multiplication.
- Create a `Command` pattern that logs each command execution.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

To better understand the transformation process, let's visualize the flow of data and control in these patterns.

#### Singleton Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Singleton {
        -instance: Singleton
        +getInstance(): Singleton
    }
    Singleton --> Singleton : "instance"
```

*Diagram 1: Java Singleton Pattern Structure*

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Atom] -->|get-singleton| B[Singleton Instance]
```

*Diagram 2: Clojure Singleton Pattern with Atom*

#### Observer Pattern Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Subject {
        -observers: List~Observer~
        +addObserver(Observer)
        +notifyObservers(String)
    }
    class Observer {
        +update(String)
    }
    Subject --> Observer : "notifies"
```

*Diagram 3: Java Observer Pattern Structure*

```
