## 11.4.3 Replacing Inheritance with Composition

As experienced Java developers, we are accustomed to using inheritance as a primary mechanism for code reuse and polymorphism. However, in Clojure, a functional programming language, we can achieve these goals more effectively through composition and higher-order functions. This section will guide you through the transition from inheritance-based designs to composition-centric approaches in Clojure, leveraging its unique features such as protocols and multimethods.

### Understanding the Limitations of Inheritance

Inheritance is a powerful tool in object-oriented programming (OOP) but comes with its own set of limitations:

- **Tight Coupling**: Inheritance creates a strong relationship between parent and child classes, making changes in the parent class potentially disruptive to child classes.
- **Fragile Base Class Problem**: Modifications to a base class can inadvertently affect all derived classes, leading to unexpected behaviors.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Inheritance hierarchies can become rigid, making it difficult to adapt to new requirements without significant refactoring.

In contrast, composition offers a more flexible and modular approach to building systems.

### Embracing Composition in Clojure

Composition in Clojure involves building complex functionality by combining simpler, reusable components. This approach aligns well with Clojure's functional programming paradigm, where functions are first-class citizens.

#### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a cornerstone of functional programming and enable powerful composition patterns.

```clojure
(defn apply-discount [discount-fn price]
  (discount-fn price))

(defn percentage-discount [percent]
  (fn [price]
    (* price (- 1 (/ percent 100)))))

;; Usage
(def ten-percent-off (percentage-discount 10))
(apply-discount ten-percent-off 100) ; => 90
```

In this example, `apply-discount` is a higher-order function that applies a discount function to a price. The `percentage-discount` function returns a new function that calculates the discounted price, demonstrating how functions can be composed to achieve desired behaviors.

#### Protocols and Polymorphism

Clojure's protocols provide a way to define a set of functions that can be implemented by different data types, offering polymorphic behavior without inheritance.

```clojure
(defprotocol Discountable
  (apply-discount [this price]))

(defrecord PercentageDiscount [percent]
  Discountable
  (apply-discount [this price]
    (* price (- 1 (/ percent 100)))))

(defrecord FixedDiscount [amount]
  Discountable
  (apply-discount [this price]
    (- price amount)))

;; Usage
(def ten-percent (->PercentageDiscount 10))
(def five-dollars (->FixedDiscount 5))

(apply-discount ten-percent 100) ; => 90
(apply-discount five-dollars 100) ; => 95
```

Here, the `Discountable` protocol defines a polymorphic `apply-discount` function. Different discount strategies are implemented using records, each providing its own implementation of the protocol.

#### Multimethods for Flexible Dispatch

Multimethods in Clojure allow for flexible method dispatch based on arbitrary criteria, not just the type of a single argument.

```clojure
(defmulti discount-type (fn [discount price] (:type discount)))

(defmethod discount-type :percentage [discount price]
  (* price (- 1 (/ (:percent discount) 100))))

(defmethod discount-type :fixed [discount price]
  (- price (:amount discount)))

;; Usage
(def percentage-discount {:type :percentage :percent 10})
(def fixed-discount {:type :fixed :amount 5})

(discount-type percentage-discount 100) ; => 90
(discount-type fixed-discount 100) ; => 95
```

Multimethods provide a powerful mechanism for achieving polymorphic behavior based on multiple criteria, offering greater flexibility than traditional inheritance.

### Comparing Composition and Inheritance

To better understand the transition from inheritance to composition, let's compare the two approaches using a simple example: a system for calculating discounts.

#### Java Inheritance Example

```java
abstract class Discount {
    abstract double apply(double price);
}

class PercentageDiscount extends Discount {
    private final double percent;

    public PercentageDiscount(double percent) {
        this.percent = percent;
    }

    @Override
    double apply(double price) {
        return price * (1 - percent / 100);
    }
}

class FixedDiscount extends Discount {
    private final double amount;

    public FixedDiscount(double amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    @Override
    double apply(double price) {
        return price - amount;
    }
}
```

In Java, we define an abstract `Discount` class and extend it to create specific discount types. This approach uses inheritance to achieve polymorphism.

#### Clojure Composition Example

```clojure
(defprotocol Discount
  (apply-discount [this price]))

(defrecord PercentageDiscount [percent]
  Discount
  (apply-discount [this price]
    (* price (- 1 (/ percent 100)))))

(defrecord FixedDiscount [amount]
  Discount
  (apply-discount [this price]
    (- price amount)))
```

In Clojure, we use protocols and records to achieve the same polymorphic behavior. This approach is more flexible and decoupled, allowing for easier modifications and extensions.

### Advantages of Composition Over Inheritance

- **Flexibility**: Composition allows for more flexible designs, as components can be easily swapped or combined.
- **Reusability**: Functions and protocols can be reused across different contexts without the constraints of an inheritance hierarchy.
- **Decoupling**: Systems built with composition are less tightly coupled, making them easier to maintain and extend.

### Practical Exercise: Refactor an Inheritance-Based Design

Let's refactor a simple Java inheritance-based design into a Clojure composition-based design. Consider a system with different types of notifications: email and SMS.

#### Java Inheritance Example

```java
abstract class Notification {
    abstract void send(String message);
}

class EmailNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending email: " + message);
    }
}

class SMSNotification extends Notification {
    @Override
    void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + message);
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Composition Example

```clojure
(defprotocol Notification
  (send-notification [this message]))

(defrecord EmailNotification []
  Notification
  (send-notification [this message]
    (println "Sending email:" message)))

(defrecord SMSNotification []
  Notification
  (send-notification [this message]
    (println "Sending SMS:" message)))

;; Usage
(def email (->EmailNotification))
(def sms (->SMSNotification))

(send-notification email "Hello via Email!")
(send-notification sms "Hello via SMS!")
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Clojure code by adding a new type of notification, such as a push notification. Implement it using the `Notification` protocol and test it with different messages.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

- **Composition over Inheritance**: Clojure encourages composition over inheritance, promoting flexibility and modularity.
- **Protocols and Multimethods**: Use protocols for polymorphism and multimethods for flexible dispatch based on multiple criteria.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Leverage higher-order functions for powerful composition patterns.

By embracing these concepts, you can build more robust and adaptable systems in Clojure, moving beyond the limitations of traditional inheritance.
