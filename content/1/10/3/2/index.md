## 10.3.2 Overriding Methods

### Introduction

As experienced Java developers, you're familiar with the concept of method overriding, a cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows subclasses to provide specific implementations of methods defined in their superclasses. In Clojure, a functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you can also override methods when extending Java classes or implementing interfaces. This section will guide you through the process of overriding methods in Clojure, highlighting the differences and similarities with Java, and providing practical examples to solidify your understanding.

### Understanding Method Overriding

In Java, method overriding is used to achieve runtime polymorphism. It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.

**Java Example:**

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `sound` method of the `Animal` class.

### Overriding Methods in Clojure

Clojure, being a functional language, approaches method overriding differently. Instead of using classes and inheritance, Clojure leverages protocols and records, as well as Java interop capabilities, to achieve similar functionality.

#### Using `proxy` for Method Overriding

One of the ways to override methods in Clojure is by using the `proxy` construct. The `proxy` function creates an instance of a class that implements one or more interfaces or extends a class, allowing you to override methods.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(def animal
  (proxy [java.lang.Object] []
    (toString [] "Animal makes a sound")))

(def dog
  (proxy [java.lang.Object] []
    (toString [] "Dog barks")))

(println (.toString animal)) ; Output: Animal makes a sound
(println (.toString dog))    ; Output: Dog barks
```

In this example, we create two proxies, `animal` and `dog`, each overriding the `toString` method of `java.lang.Object`.

#### Implementing Interfaces with `reify`

Clojure's `reify` is another powerful construct that allows you to implement interfaces and override methods. It is more concise than `proxy` and is typically used for implementing interfaces rather than extending classes.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(defn make-dog []
  (reify
    java.lang.Runnable
    (run [this]
      (println "Dog runs"))))

(def dog (make-dog))
(.run dog) ; Output: Dog runs
```

Here, we use `reify` to implement the `Runnable` interface and override its `run` method.

### Comparing Clojure and Java Approaches

While Java uses inheritance and the `@Override` annotation to achieve method overriding, Clojure provides constructs like `proxy` and `reify` to interact with Java classes and interfaces. These constructs allow you to override methods without the need for class inheritance, aligning with Clojure's functional programming paradigm.

#### Key Differences

- **Inheritance vs. Composition**: Java relies on class inheritance, while Clojure emphasizes composition through protocols and records.
- **Annotations**: Java uses annotations like `@Override` to indicate method overriding, whereas Clojure uses constructs like `proxy` and `reify`.
- **Syntax**: Clojure's syntax is more concise and functional, focusing on behavior rather than class hierarchies.

### Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to deepen our understanding of method overriding in Clojure.

#### Example 1: Overriding a Java Method

Suppose we have a Java class `Vehicle` with a method `move`.

**Java Class:**

```java
public class Vehicle {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is moving");
    }
}
```

We can override the `move` method in Clojure using `proxy`.

**Clojure Code:**

```clojure
(def vehicle
  (proxy [Vehicle] []
    (move []
      (println "Car is moving"))))

(.move vehicle) ; Output: Car is moving
```

In this example, we create a proxy for the `Vehicle` class and override the `move` method to provide a custom implementation.

#### Example 2: Implementing a Java Interface

Consider a Java interface `Flyable` with a method `fly`.

**Java Interface:**

```java
public interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}
```

We can implement this interface in Clojure using `reify`.

**Clojure Code:**

```clojure
(defn make-bird []
  (reify
    Flyable
    (fly [this]
      (println "Bird is flying"))))

(def bird (make-bird))
(.fly bird) ; Output: Bird is flying
```

Here, we use `reify` to implement the `Flyable` interface and override its `fly` method.

### Try It Yourself

To gain hands-on experience, try modifying the examples above:

- Change the messages printed by the overridden methods.
- Create additional methods in the Java classes and override them in Clojure.
- Implement multiple interfaces using `reify`.

### Diagrams and Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of method overriding in Clojure, let's visualize the process using a class diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        +move()
    }
    class ClojureProxy {
        +move()
    }
    Vehicle <|-- ClojureProxy
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates how a Clojure proxy extends a Java class (`Vehicle`) and overrides its method (`move`).
