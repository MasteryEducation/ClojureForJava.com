## 10.3.3 Compiling and Using Generated Classes

In this section, we will explore how to compile Clojure code that uses `gen-class` into Java bytecode, package it, and use the generated classes in Java applications. This process is crucial for Java developers who want to leverage Clojure's functional programming capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing Java systems.

### Understanding `gen-class`

The `gen-class` directive in Clojure is a powerful tool that allows you to define a Java class from Clojure code. This feature is particularly useful when you need to implement Java interfaces or extend Java classes directly from Clojure. By using `gen-class`, you can create classes that can be compiled into Java bytecode and used seamlessly in Java applications.

#### Key Concepts of `gen-class`

- **Class Definition**: `gen-class` allows you to define a class with specified methods, fields, and constructors.
- **Interoperability**: The generated class can implement Java interfaces and extend Java classes, making it fully interoperable with Java code.
- **Compilation**: Once defined, the class can be compiled into Java bytecode, which can be packaged and distributed like any other Java class.

### Defining a Class with `gen-class`

Let's start by defining a simple class using `gen-class`. Suppose we want to create a class `Greeter` that implements a Java interface `IGreet`.

**Java Interface:**

```java
public interface IGreet {
    String greet(String name);
}
```

**Clojure Class Definition:**

```clojure
(ns myapp.greeter
  (:gen-class
   :name myapp.Greeter
   :implements [myapp.IGreet]
   :methods [[greet [String] String]]))

(defn -greet
  [this name]
  (str "Hello, " name "!"))
```

In this example, we define a class `myapp.Greeter` that implements the `IGreet` interface. The `-greet` function provides the implementation for the `greet` method.

### Compiling Clojure Code to Java Bytecode

To compile the Clojure code into Java bytecode, we need to use a build tool like Leiningen or the Clojure CLI with `tools.deps`. Let's explore both methods.

#### Using Leiningen

1. **Project Setup**: Create a new Leiningen project.

   ```bash
   lein new app myapp
   ```

2. **Modify `project.clj`**: Add the `:aot` (ahead-of-time compilation) directive to specify the namespaces to compile.

   ```clojure
   (defproject myapp "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]]
     :aot [myapp.greeter]
     :main ^:skip-aot myapp.core)
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**: Run the following command to compile the project.

   ```bash
   lein compile
   ```

This command compiles the Clojure code into Java bytecode, generating `.class` files in the `target/classes` directory.

#### Using Clojure CLI and `tools.deps`

1. **Create `deps.edn`**: Define your project dependencies and paths.

   ```clojure
   {:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}
    :paths ["src"]
    :aliases {:compile {:main-opts ["-e" "(compile 'myapp.greeter)"]}}}
   ```

2. **Compile the Namespace**: Use the following command to compile the namespace.

   ```bash
   clj -M:compile
   ```

This command compiles the specified namespace into Java bytecode.

### Packaging the Compiled Classes

Once the classes are compiled, the next step is to package them into a JAR file for distribution and use in Java applications.

#### Creating a JAR with Leiningen

1. **Build the JAR**: Use the following command to create a JAR file.

   ```bash
   lein uberjar
   ```

This command packages the compiled classes and dependencies into a standalone JAR file.

#### Creating a JAR with Clojure CLI

1. **Use `depstar`**: Add `depstar` as a tool for building JAR files.

   ```clojure
   {:deps {seancorfield/depstar {:mvn/version "2.0.211"}}}
   ```

2. **Build the JAR**: Run the following command to create a JAR file.

   ```bash
   clj -X:uberjar :jar "myapp.jar" :main-class myapp.core
   ```

### Using the Generated Classes in Java

Now that we have a JAR file, we can use the generated classes in a Java application.

**Java Application Example:**

```java
import myapp.Greeter;
import myapp.IGreet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IGreet greeter = new Greeter();
        System.out.println(greeter.greet("World"));
    }
}
```

In this example, we import the `Greeter` class and use it to greet the world. The Clojure-generated class behaves like any other Java class.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the `Greeter` class to include additional methods or implement another interface. Experiment with different method signatures and observe how the changes affect the Java application.

### Visualizing the Process

Below is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the flow from Clojure code to Java application integration.

### Key Takeaways

- **Interoperability**: `gen-class` enables seamless integration between Clojure and Java, allowing you to leverage Clojure's functional programming features in Java applications.
- **Compilation**: Clojure code can be compiled into Java bytecode, making it compatible with Java's ecosystem.
- **Packaging**: Tools like Leiningen and `depstar` facilitate the packaging of Clojure code into JAR files for distribution.
- **Flexibility**: The ability to implement Java interfaces and extend classes from Clojure provides flexibility in application design.
