## 7.7.1 Implementing Algorithms

In this section, we will explore how to implement classic algorithms such as quicksort and mergesort using Clojure, leveraging its functional programming capabilities. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with these algorithms in an imperative context. Here, we'll demonstrate how Clojure's recursive and functional paradigms offer a different approach, often leading to more concise and expressive code.

### Understanding Recursion in Clojure

Before diving into specific algorithms, it's crucial to understand how recursion works in Clojure. Unlike Java, which often relies on iterative loops, Clojure encourages recursion, especially with its support for tail recursion through the `recur` keyword.

#### Tail Recursion and `recur`

Tail recursion is a form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. Clojure optimizes tail-recursive functions using the `recur` keyword, allowing them to execute in constant stack space.

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (loop [acc 1, n n]
    (if (zero? n)
      acc
      (recur (* acc n) (dec n)))))
```

In this example, `factorial` uses `loop` and `recur` to compute the factorial of a number without growing the stack, similar to a loop in Java.

### Implementing Quicksort

Quicksort is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, then recursively sorting the sub-arrays.

#### Quicksort in Java

Here's a typical implementation of quicksort in Java:

```java
public class QuickSort {
    public static void quickSort(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(array, low, high);
            quickSort(array, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(array, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private static int partition(int[] array, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = array[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (array[j] <= pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[j];
                array[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        int temp = array[i + 1];
        array[i + 1] = array[high];
        array[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```

#### Quicksort in Clojure

In Clojure, we can implement quicksort using recursion and immutable data structures:

```clojure
(defn quicksort [coll]
  (if (empty? coll)
    coll
    (let [pivot (first coll)
          rest (rest coll)
          less (filter #(<= % pivot) rest)
          greater (filter #(> % pivot) rest)]
      (concat (quicksort less) [pivot] (quicksort greater)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: If the collection is empty, return it.
- **Recursive Case**: Choose a pivot (first element), partition the rest into `less` and `greater` sub-collections, and recursively sort them.

**Diagram: Quicksort Flow**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is collection empty?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return collection]
    B -- No --> D[Choose pivot]
    D --> E[Partition into less and greater]
    E --> F[Recursively sort less]
    E --> G[Recursively sort greater]
    F --> H[Concatenate results]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Return sorted collection]
```

This diagram illustrates the recursive flow of the quicksort algorithm in Clojure.

### Implementing Mergesort

Mergesort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.

#### Mergesort in Java

Here's how mergesort might look in Java:

```java
public class MergeSort {
    public static void mergeSort(int[] array, int left, int right) {
        if (left < right) {
            int middle = (left + right) / 2;
            mergeSort(array, left, middle);
            mergeSort(array, middle + 1, right);
            merge(array, left, middle, right);
        }
    }

    private static void merge(int[] array, int left, int middle, int right) {
        int n1 = middle - left + 1;
        int n2 = right - middle;
        int[] L = new int[n1];
        int[] R = new int[n2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
            L[i] = array[left + i];
        for (int j = 0; j < n2; ++j)
            R[j] = array[middle + 1 + j];
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int k = left;
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
                array[k] = L[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                array[k] = R[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }
        while (i < n1) {
            array[k] = L[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }
        while (j < n2) {
            array[k] = R[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }
}
```

#### Mergesort in Clojure

In Clojure, mergesort can be implemented using recursion and higher-order functions:

```clojure
(defn merge [left right]
  (cond
    (empty? left) right
    (empty? right) left
    :else (let [l (first left)
                r (first right)]
            (if (<= l r)
              (cons l (merge (rest left) right))
              (cons r (merge left (rest right)))))))

(defn mergesort [coll]
  (if (<= (count coll) 1)
    coll
    (let [mid (quot (count coll) 2)
          left (subvec coll 0 mid)
          right (subvec coll mid)]
      (merge (mergesort left) (mergesort right)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: If the collection has one or zero elements, it's already sorted.
- **Recursive Case**: Split the collection into two halves, recursively sort each half, and merge the sorted halves.

**Diagram: Mergesort Flow**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is collection size <= 1?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return collection]
    B -- No --> D[Split into left and right]
    D --> E[Recursively sort left]
    D --> F[Recursively sort right]
    E --> G[Merge sorted halves]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Return sorted collection]
```

This diagram shows the recursive flow of the mergesort algorithm in Clojure.

### Traversing Data Structures

Traversing data structures is a common task in algorithm implementation. In Clojure, recursion and higher-order functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` are often used for this purpose.

#### Traversing a Binary Tree

Let's implement a simple binary tree traversal in Clojure.

```clojure
(defn inorder-traversal [tree]
  (when tree
    (concat (inorder-traversal (:left tree))
            [(:value tree)]
            (inorder-traversal (:right tree)))))

;; Example usage
(def tree {:value 1
           :left {:value 2
                  :left nil
                  :right nil}
           :right {:value 3
                   :left nil
                   :right nil}})

(inorder-traversal tree) ;; => (2 1 3)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: If the tree is `nil`, return an empty list.
- **Recursive Case**: Traverse the left subtree, visit the root, and traverse the right subtree.

**Diagram: Inorder Traversal**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is tree nil?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Return empty list]
    B -- No --> D[Traverse left subtree]
    D --> E[Visit root]
    E --> F[Traverse right subtree]
    F --> G[Concatenate results]
    G --> H[Return traversal list]
```

This diagram illustrates the recursive flow of an inorder traversal in a binary tree.
