## 7.3.2 Returning Functions

In the realm of functional programming, the ability to return functions from other functions is a powerful concept that allows developers to create highly modular and reusable code. This capability is a cornerstone of higher-order functions and is particularly well-supported in Clojure. For Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding how functions can return other functions is key to harnessing the full potential of functional programming paradigms.

### Understanding Function Return Values

In Clojure, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned as values, and assigned to variables. This flexibility allows developers to construct complex behaviors through simple, composable units. Returning functions from other functions is a natural extension of this concept, enabling the creation of dynamic and adaptable code structures.

Consider the following example, which demonstrates a function returning another function:

```clojure
(defn multiplier
  [factor]
  (fn [x] (* x factor)))

(def double (multiplier 2))
(double 5) ;=> 10
```

In this example, the `multiplier` function takes a `factor` as an argument and returns a new function. This returned function, when called with a value `x`, multiplies `x` by the `factor`. The `double` function is created by calling `multiplier` with `2`, effectively creating a function that doubles its input.

### Closures: Capturing the Environment

One of the most intriguing aspects of returning functions is the concept of closures. A closure is a function that captures and "remembers" the environment in which it was created. This means that the returned function retains access to the variables and parameters that were in scope at the time of its creation.

In the `multiplier` example, the returned function is a closure that captures the `factor` variable. Even after the `multiplier` function has finished executing, the returned function retains access to `factor`, allowing it to perform the multiplication operation correctly.

#### Example: Creating a Custom Adder

Let's explore another example to solidify our understanding of closures:

```clojure
(defn adder
  [increment]
  (fn [x] (+ x increment)))

(def add-five (adder 5))
(add-five 10) ;=> 15
```

In this case, the `adder` function returns a closure that adds a specified `increment` to its input. The `add-five` function is a closure that remembers the `increment` value of `5`, allowing it to add five to any given number.

### Practical Applications of Returning Functions

Returning functions can be used to create a variety of practical and powerful abstractions. Here are a few common use cases:

#### 1. Function Factories

A function factory is a function that generates other functions based on input parameters. This pattern is useful for creating customized functions without duplicating code.

```clojure
(defn power-factory
  [exponent]
  (fn [base] (Math/pow base exponent)))

(def square (power-factory 2))
(def cube (power-factory 3))

(square 4) ;=> 16.0
(cube 2) ;=> 8.0
```

In this example, `power-factory` creates functions that raise a base number to a specified exponent. The `square` and `cube` functions are generated by calling `power-factory` with `2` and `3`, respectively.

#### 2. Stateful Computations

Closures can also be used to maintain state across multiple invocations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where stateful computations are required without resorting to mutable state.

```clojure
(defn counter
  [initial]
  (let [count (atom initial)]
    (fn [] (swap! count inc))))

(def my-counter (counter 0))
(my-counter) ;=> 1
(my-counter) ;=> 2
```

Here, the `counter` function returns a closure that maintains an internal count using an atom. Each time the returned function is called, the count is incremented.

### Best Practices and Considerations

When working with functions that return other functions, it's important to keep a few best practices in mind:

- **Avoid Excessive Nesting:** While returning functions can lead to elegant solutions, excessive nesting can make code difficult to read and maintain. Strive for clarity and simplicity.
- **Leverage Immutability:** Use immutable data structures and avoid side effects to ensure that closures behave predictably.
- **Document Closures Clearly:** Since closures capture their environment, it's crucial to document their behavior and any captured variables to aid understanding and maintenance.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Unintentional State Capture:** Be mindful of the variables that closures capture. Unintentional state capture can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in concurrent environments.
- **Performance Considerations:** While closures are powerful, they can introduce overhead if not used judiciously. Consider the performance implications of capturing large or complex environments.

### Advanced Techniques

#### Currying and Partial Application

Returning functions is closely related to the concepts of currying and partial application. Currying transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument. Partial application, on the other hand, involves fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

```clojure
(defn curried-add
  [a]
  (fn [b]
    (fn [c]
      (+ a b c))))

(def add-one (curried-add 1))
(def add-one-and-two (add-one 2))
(add-one-and-two 3) ;=> 6
```

In this example, `curried-add` is a curried function that adds three numbers. Each invocation returns a new function that takes the next argument.

#### Function Composition

Function composition is another powerful technique enabled by returning functions. It involves combining multiple functions to create a new function that applies them in sequence.

```clojure
(defn compose
  [f g]
  (fn [x] (f (g x))))

(defn inc [x] (+ x 1))
(defn double [x] (* x 2))

(def inc-then-double (compose double inc))
(inc-then-double 3) ;=> 8
```

The `compose` function creates a new function that applies `g` to its input and then applies `f` to the result. In this case, `inc-then-double` first increments its input and then doubles it.

### Conclusion

Returning functions is a fundamental concept in Clojure that empowers developers to create flexible, reusable, and expressive code. By understanding and leveraging closures, function factories, and advanced techniques like currying and composition, you can unlock the full potential of functional programming in your Clojure applications.

As you continue to explore Clojure, consider how returning functions can simplify your code and enhance its modularity. Whether you're building complex systems or simple utilities, this powerful technique will undoubtedly become an invaluable tool in your functional programming toolkit.

### What is a closure in Clojure?

- [x] A function that captures and remembers the environment in which it was created.
- [ ] A function that can only be used once.
- [ ] A function that does not take any arguments.
- [ ] A function that is defined inside another function.

> **Explanation:** A closure is a function that captures and remembers the environment in which it was created, allowing it to access those variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

### What does the following Clojure code return? `(def double (multiplier 2)) (double 5)`

- [x] 10
