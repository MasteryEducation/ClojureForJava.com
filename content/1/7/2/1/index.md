## 7.2.1 Writing Recursive Functions

### Introduction

As experienced Java developers, you're likely familiar with the concept of recursion, where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In Clojure, recursion is a fundamental technique, often used in place of traditional loops. This section will guide you through writing recursive functions in Clojure, using examples like calculating factorials, Fibonacci numbers, and traversing tree structures. We'll also explore how Clojure's approach to recursion differs from Java's, particularly with its emphasis on immutability and tail recursion.

### Understanding Recursion in Clojure

Recursion in Clojure is a natural fit due to its functional programming paradigm. Unlike Java, which often uses iterative loops, Clojure encourages recursive solutions that align with its immutable data structures. Let's start by examining the basic structure of a recursive function in Clojure.

#### Basic Structure of a Recursive Function

A recursive function typically consists of two parts:

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion stops.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments.

In Clojure, recursion is often implemented using the `recur` keyword, which optimizes tail-recursive calls to prevent stack overflow errors.

### Example 1: Calculating Factorials

Let's begin with a classic example: calculating the factorial of a number. In Java, you might write a recursive factorial function like this:

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

In Clojure, the equivalent recursive function can be written as follows:

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: When `n` is less than or equal to 1, return 1.
- **Recursive Case**: Multiply `n` by the factorial of `n-1`.

#### Tail Recursion with `recur`

Clojure provides the `recur` keyword to optimize recursive calls, making them tail-recursive. This is crucial for performance, as it prevents stack overflow by reusing the current function's stack frame.

Here's how you can rewrite the factorial function using `recur`:

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (let [fact-helper (fn [n acc]
                      (if (<= n 1)
                        acc
                        (recur (dec n) (* n acc))))]
    (fact-helper n 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Helper Function**: `fact-helper` is a local function that carries an accumulator `acc`.
- **Base Case**: When `n` is less than or equal to 1, return the accumulator.
- **Recursive Case**: Call `recur` with `n-1` and the updated accumulator.

### Example 2: Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci sequence is another classic example of recursion. In Java, a simple recursive Fibonacci function might look like this:

```java
public class Fibonacci {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```

In Clojure, the recursive Fibonacci function can be written as:

```clojure
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    n
    (+ (fibonacci (- n 1))
       (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: When `n` is 0 or 1, return `n`.
- **Recursive Case**: Sum the results of `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`.

#### Optimizing Fibonacci with `recur`

The naive recursive approach to Fibonacci is inefficient due to repeated calculations. We can optimize it using `recur`:

```clojure
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (let [fib-helper (fn [a b n]
                     (if (zero? n)
                       a
                       (recur b (+ a b) (dec n))))]
    (fib-helper 0 1 n)))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Helper Function**: `fib-helper` uses two accumulators, `a` and `b`, to store the last two Fibonacci numbers.
- **Base Case**: When `n` is 0, return `a`.
- **Recursive Case**: Call `recur` with updated accumulators.

### Example 3: Tree Traversal

Recursion is particularly useful for traversing tree structures. Let's consider a simple binary tree traversal. In Java, you might write a recursive method to traverse a binary tree in-order:

```java
class Node {
    int value;
    Node left, right;

    Node(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

public class BinaryTree {
    Node root;

    void inOrder(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        inOrder(node.left);
        System.out.print(node.value + " ");
        inOrder(node.right);
    }
}
```

In Clojure, we can represent a binary tree as nested maps and write a recursive function to traverse it:

```clojure
(defn in-order [tree]
  (when tree
    (concat (in-order (:left tree))
            [(:value tree)]
            (in-order (:right tree)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Base Case**: When the tree is `nil`, return an empty list.
- **Recursive Case**: Concatenate the results of traversing the left subtree, the root value, and the right subtree.

### Visualizing Recursion with Diagrams

To better understand how recursion works, let's visualize the recursive process using a flowchart. Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of the factorial function:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{n <= 1?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Return 1];
    B -- No --> D[Calculate n * factorial(n-1)];
    D --> B;
```

**Diagram Explanation**: This flowchart shows the decision-making process in the recursive factorial function, highlighting the base and recursive cases.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored recursive functions, try modifying the examples:

- **Factorial**: Implement a version that calculates the factorial of a number using iteration instead of recursion.
- **Fibonacci**: Modify the Fibonacci function to return a sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to `n`.
- **Tree Traversal**: Extend the tree traversal function to perform pre-order and post-order traversals.

### Exercises

1. **Write a Recursive Function**: Implement a recursive function in Clojure to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.
2. **Optimize with `recur`**: Rewrite the sum function using `recur` to make it tail-recursive.
3. **Tree Depth**: Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree.

### Key Takeaways

- **Recursion in Clojure**: Emphasizes immutability and functional programming principles.
- **Tail Recursion**: Use `recur` to optimize recursive functions and prevent stack overflow.
- **Practical Applications**: Recursive functions are ideal for problems like factorials, Fibonacci numbers, and tree traversal.

By mastering recursive functions in Clojure, you can leverage the power of functional programming to write elegant and efficient code. As you continue your journey, remember to experiment with different recursive patterns and explore how they can simplify complex problems.
