## 14.3.3 Next.jdbc

As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for interacting with relational databases. In Clojure, `next.jdbc` is a modern, high-performance library that provides a more idiomatic and efficient way to work with databases. This section will introduce `next.jdbc`, demonstrate how to perform common database operations, and highlight its advantages over traditional JDBC.

### Introduction to Next.jdbc

`next.jdbc` is a Clojure library designed to simplify database interactions while maintaining high performance. It builds upon the foundation of JDBC, offering a more functional approach that aligns with Clojure's paradigms. Unlike traditional JDBC, which often involves verbose and imperative code, `next.jdbc` allows for concise and expressive database operations.

#### Key Features of Next.jdbc

- **Simplicity and Performance**: Provides a straightforward API that leverages Clojure's strengths, such as immutability and functional programming.
- **Data-Driven**: Returns data in Clojure's native data structures, making it easy to work with.
- **Extensibility**: Supports custom data transformations and extensions.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing JDBC drivers and databases.

### Setting Up Next.jdbc

Before diving into code examples, let's set up `next.jdbc` in your Clojure project. Ensure you have a working Clojure environment and a database to connect to.

#### Adding Next.jdbc to Your Project

Add the following dependency to your `deps.edn` or `project.clj` file:

```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        seancorfield/next.jdbc {:mvn/version "1.2.780"}}}

;; project.clj
(defproject my-clojure-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [seancorfield/next.jdbc "1.2.780"]])
```

#### Setting Up a Database Connection

To connect to a database, you'll need a JDBC URL and credentials. Here's how to establish a connection using `next.jdbc`:

```clojure
(require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "h2" ; Replace with your database type, e.g., "mysql", "postgresql"
   :dbname "testdb"
   :user "sa"
   :password ""})

(def datasource (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec))
```

### Performing Common Database Operations

Let's explore how to perform common database operations using `next.jdbc`, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

#### Querying Data

Fetching data from a database is a fundamental operation. With `next.jdbc`, you can execute queries and retrieve results as Clojure data structures.

```clojure
(defn fetch-users []
  (jdbc/execute! datasource ["SELECT * FROM users"]))
```

The `execute!` function executes the SQL query and returns the results as a vector of maps, where each map represents a row.

#### Inserting Data

Inserting data into a database is straightforward with `next.jdbc`. Use the `execute!` function with an insert statement.

```clojure
(defn insert-user [name email]
  (jdbc/execute! datasource
                 ["INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)" name email]))
```

This function inserts a new user into the `users` table, using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

#### Updating Data

Updating existing records is similar to inserting. Use the `execute!` function with an update statement.

```clojure
(defn update-user-email [id new-email]
  (jdbc/execute! datasource
                 ["UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE id = ?" new-email id]))
```

This function updates the email of a user identified by their `id`.

#### Deleting Data

Deleting records is also straightforward. Use the `execute!` function with a delete statement.

```clojure
(defn delete-user [id]
  (jdbc/execute! datasource
                 ["DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?" id]))
```

This function deletes a user from the `users` table based on their `id`.

### Advanced Features of Next.jdbc

Beyond basic CRUD operations, `next.jdbc` offers advanced features that enhance its functionality and performance.

#### Handling Transactions

Transactions ensure that a series of operations either complete successfully or have no effect. Use `with-transaction` to manage transactions in `next.jdbc`.

```clojure
(defn transfer-funds [from-account to-account amount]
  (jdbc/with-transaction [tx datasource]
    (jdbc/execute! tx ["UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?" amount from-account])
    (jdbc/execute! tx ["UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?" amount to-account])))
```

This function transfers funds between two accounts, ensuring atomicity.

#### Customizing Data Transformations

`next.jdbc` allows you to customize how data is transformed when retrieved from the database. Use the `:builder-fn` option to specify a custom transformation function.

```clojure
(defn snake-to-kebab [s]
  (clojure.string/replace s "_" "-"))

(defn custom-fetch-users []
  (jdbc/execute! datasource
                 ["SELECT * FROM users"]
                 {:builder-fn (jdbc/as-unqualified-lower-maps snake-to-kebab)}))
```

This example transforms column names from snake_case to kebab-case.

#### Connection Pooling

Efficient database connections are crucial for performance. `next.jdbc` supports connection pooling through libraries like HikariCP.

```clojure
(require '[hikari-cp.core :as hikari])

(def pooled-datasource
  (hikari/make-datasource {:jdbc-url "jdbc:h2:mem:testdb"
                           :username "sa"
                           :password ""}))
```

### Comparing Next.jdbc with Java's JDBC

Let's compare `next.jdbc` with traditional JDBC to highlight the differences and advantages.

#### Java JDBC Example

Here's a typical JDBC example in Java for querying data:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class JdbcExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:h2:mem:testdb", "sa", "")) {
            Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("User: " + rs.getString("name"));
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Clojure Next.jdbc Example

The equivalent operation in Clojure using `next.jdbc` is more concise and expressive:

```clojure
(defn fetch-users []
  (jdbc/execute! datasource ["SELECT * FROM users"]))
```

#### Key Differences

- **Conciseness**: `next.jdbc` reduces boilerplate code, making it easier to read and maintain.
- **Functional Style**: Aligns with Clojure's functional programming paradigm, using immutable data structures.
- **Data Transformation**: Provides built-in support for transforming data into Clojure-friendly formats.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following modifications to deepen your understanding of `next.jdbc`:

- **Add a New Table**: Create a new table and perform CRUD operations on it.
- **Implement Joins**: Write queries that join multiple tables and retrieve combined results.
- **Use Connection Pooling**: Set up connection pooling and observe performance improvements.
