## 14.4.3 Other Datastores

In this section, we will delve into integrating Clojure with various popular datastores, specifically MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. These datastores are widely used in the industry due to their scalability, flexibility, and performance. We will explore how to use Clojure libraries such as `monger`, `cassaforte`, and `carmine` to interact with these datastores, providing clear examples and comparisons with Java to highlight the differences and similarities.

### MongoDB with Monger

MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability. In Clojure, the `monger` library, part of the `clojurewerkz` suite, provides a robust interface for interacting with MongoDB.

#### Setting Up Monger

To get started with Monger, add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[clojurewerkz/monger "3.1.0"]]
```

#### Connecting to MongoDB

Let's begin by establishing a connection to a MongoDB instance:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]))

;; Connect to MongoDB
(def conn (mg/connect))
(def db (mg/get-db conn "my_database"))

;; Insert a document
(mc/insert db "my_collection" {:name "John Doe" :age 30})

;; Find a document
(defn find-user [name]
  (mc/find-one-as-map db "my_collection" {:name name}))

;; Usage
(println (find-user "John Doe"))
```

**Explanation:**
- We establish a connection using `mg/connect` and retrieve the database with `mg/get-db`.
- We insert a document into a collection using `mc/insert`.
- We define a function `find-user` to retrieve a document based on a query.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, interacting with MongoDB involves using the MongoDB Java Driver. Here's a simple example:

```java
import com.mongodb.MongoClient;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoCollection;
import com.mongodb.client.MongoDatabase;
import org.bson.Document;

public class MongoExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient("localhost", 27017);
        MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("my_database");
        MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("my_collection");

        // Insert a document
        Document doc = new Document("name", "John Doe").append("age", 30);
        collection.insertOne(doc);

        // Find a document
        Document found = collection.find(new Document("name", "John Doe")).first();
        System.out.println(found.toJson());
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**
- Both Clojure and Java require setting up a connection and accessing a database and collection.
- Clojure's syntax is more concise and leverages functional programming paradigms, making it easier to express queries and transformations.

### Cassandra with Cassaforte

Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers. The `cassaforte` library provides a Clojure interface to interact with Cassandra.

#### Setting Up Cassaforte

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[clojurewerkz/cassaforte "3.0.0"]]
```

#### Connecting to Cassandra

Here's how you can connect to a Cassandra cluster and perform basic operations:

```clojure
(ns myapp.cassandra
  (:require [qbits.alia :as alia]
            [qbits.hayt :refer :all]))

;; Connect to Cassandra
(def cluster (alia/cluster {:contact-points ["127.0.0.1"]}))
(def session (alia/connect cluster))

;; Create a keyspace and table
(alia/execute session (create-keyspace :my_keyspace
                                       (if-not-exists)
                                       (with {:replication {:class "SimpleStrategy"
                                                            :replication_factor 1}})))

(alia/execute session (use-keyspace :my_keyspace))

(alia/execute session (create-table :users
                                    (if-not-exists)
                                    (column-definitions {:id :uuid
                                                         :name :text
                                                         :age :int
                                                         :primary-key [:id]})))

;; Insert a user
(defn insert-user [id name age]
  (alia/execute session
                (insert :users
                        (values {:id id :name name :age age}))))

;; Usage
(insert-user (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) "Alice" 25)
```

**Explanation:**
- We establish a connection using `alia/cluster` and `alia/connect`.
- We create a keyspace and table using CQL (Cassandra Query Language) commands.
- We define a function `insert-user` to insert data into the `users` table.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, using the DataStax Java Driver, the process is as follows:

```java
import com.datastax.driver.core.Cluster;
import com.datastax.driver.core.Session;
import java.util.UUID;

public class CassandraExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Cluster cluster = Cluster.builder().addContactPoint("127.0.0.1").build();
        Session session = cluster.connect();

        // Create keyspace and table
        session.execute("CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS my_keyspace WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1};");
        session.execute("USE my_keyspace;");
        session.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id uuid PRIMARY KEY, name text, age int);");

        // Insert a user
        UUID id = UUID.randomUUID();
        session.execute("INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (" + id + ", 'Alice', 25);");
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**
- Both languages require setting up a cluster and session.
- Clojure's `cassaforte` library provides a more idiomatic and concise way to express CQL commands using Clojure data structures.

### Redis with Carmine

Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. The `carmine` library is a popular choice for interacting with Redis in Clojure.

#### Setting Up Carmine

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[com.taoensso/carmine "2.19.1"]]
```

#### Connecting to Redis

Here's how you can connect to Redis and perform basic operations:

```clojure
(ns myapp.redis
  (:require [taoensso.carmine :as car]))

(def server-conn {:pool {} :spec {:host "127.0.0.1" :port 6379}})

(defmacro wcar* [& body] `(car/wcar server-conn ~@body))

;; Set and get a value
(wcar* (car/set "my-key" "Hello, Redis!"))
(println (wcar* (car/get "my-key")))
```

**Explanation:**
- We define a connection map `server-conn` with Redis server details.
- We use the `wcar*` macro to wrap Redis commands, ensuring they execute within a connection context.
- We perform basic `set` and `get` operations.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, using the Jedis library, the process is as follows:

```java
import redis.clients.jedis.Jedis;

public class RedisExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Jedis jedis = new Jedis("localhost");
        
        // Set and get a value
        jedis.set("my-key", "Hello, Redis!");
        System.out.println(jedis.get("my-key"));
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**
- Both Clojure and Java require setting up a connection to the Redis server.
- Clojure's `carmine` library provides a macro-based approach to manage Redis commands, which can be more expressive and concise.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored how to integrate Clojure with MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis, try modifying the examples to suit your needs:

- **MongoDB**: Add more fields to the document and perform complex queries.
- **Cassandra**: Experiment with different data types and CQL commands.
- **Redis**: Implement a simple caching mechanism using Redis.

### Diagrams

To better understand the flow of data and operations in these datastores, let's visualize the interactions using Mermaid.js diagrams.
