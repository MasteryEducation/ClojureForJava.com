## 14.4.2 Working with Datomic

Datomic is a distributed database system designed to enable scalable, flexible, and intelligent applications. It is particularly well-suited for Clojure developers due to its immutable data model and functional programming principles. In this section, we will explore how to connect to Datomic, define schemas, perform queries using Datalog, and handle transactions. We'll also draw parallels with Java's traditional database approaches to highlight the advantages of using Datomic.

### Introduction to Datomic

Datomic is unique in its approach to data management. Unlike traditional databases, which often focus on mutable state, Datomic emphasizes immutability and time-based data. This allows developers to query not only the current state of the data but also its history, providing a powerful tool for auditing and analysis.

#### Key Features of Datomic

- **Immutability**: Data in Datomic is immutable, meaning once written, it cannot be changed. This aligns with functional programming principles and simplifies reasoning about data.
- **Time-based Queries**: Datomic allows you to query data as of any point in time, providing a historical view of your data.
- **Datalog Queries**: Datomic uses Datalog, a declarative query language, which is more expressive and flexible than SQL.
- **Schema Flexibility**: Datomic schemas are flexible and can evolve over time without requiring migrations.

### Connecting to Datomic

To start working with Datomic, you need to set up a connection to a Datomic database. Datomic provides both a free version, Datomic Free, and a commercial version, Datomic Pro. For this guide, we'll focus on Datomic Free.

#### Setting Up Datomic

1. **Download Datomic**: You can download Datomic Free from the [official Datomic website](https://www.datomic.com/).
2. **Start the Transactor**: The transactor is responsible for managing transactions and coordinating with the storage service. You can start it using the following command:

   ```bash
   bin/transactor config/dev-transactor-template.properties
   ```

3. **Connect to the Database**: In your Clojure project, you can connect to the Datomic database using the following code:

   ```clojure
   (require '[datomic.api :as d])

   ;; Connect to the Datomic database
   (def uri "datomic:free://localhost:4334/my-database")
   (def conn (d/connect uri))
   ```

   Here, `uri` specifies the location of your Datomic database, and `conn` is the connection object you'll use to interact with the database.

### Defining Schemas

Schemas in Datomic define the structure of your data. They specify the attributes that entities can have and the types of those attributes.

#### Creating a Schema

A schema in Datomic is defined using a set of transactions that add attributes to the database. Here's an example schema for a simple user entity:

```clojure
(def user-schema
  [{:db/ident       :user/name
    :db/valueType   :db.type/string
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
    :db/doc         "The user's name"}

   {:db/ident       :user/email
    :db/valueType   :db.type/string
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
    :db/unique      :db.unique/identity
    :db/doc         "The user's email address"}

   {:db/ident       :user/age
    :db/valueType   :db.type/long
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
    :db/doc         "The user's age"}])

;; Transact the schema
@(d/transact conn {:tx-data user-schema})
```

- **:db/ident**: The identifier for the attribute.
- **:db/valueType**: The type of value the attribute can hold.
- **:db/cardinality**: Specifies whether the attribute can have one or many values.
- **:db/unique**: Ensures the attribute value is unique across entities.

#### Schema Evolution

Datomic allows you to evolve your schema over time. You can add new attributes or modify existing ones without needing to migrate your data. This is a significant advantage over traditional databases, where schema changes can be complex and error-prone.

### Performing Queries Using Datalog

Datalog is a powerful query language used by Datomic. It allows you to express complex queries in a concise and readable manner.

#### Basic Datalog Queries

Let's start with a simple query to find all users in the database:

```clojure
(def query '[:find ?e ?name
             :where [?e :user/name ?name]])

;; Execute the query
(d/q query (d/db conn))
```

- **:find**: Specifies the variables to return.
- **:where**: Defines the conditions that must be met for the query to return a result.

#### Advanced Queries

Datalog supports more complex queries, including joins and aggregations. Here's an example of a query that finds users over a certain age:

```clojure
(def query '[:find ?e ?name
             :where [?e :user/name ?name]
                    [?e :user/age ?age]
                    [(> ?age 30)]])

;; Execute the query
(d/q query (d/db conn))
```

This query uses a predicate `[(> ?age 30)]` to filter results based on age.

#### Comparing Datalog and SQL

Datalog is more expressive than SQL, allowing you to write queries that are both concise and powerful. Here's a comparison of a simple query in both languages:

**Datalog**:
```clojure
[:find ?name
 :where [?e :user/name ?name]]
```

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT name FROM users;
```

While both queries achieve the same result, Datalog's syntax is more flexible and can easily accommodate more complex queries.

### Handling Transactions

Transactions in Datomic are used to add, update, or retract data. They are immutable and can be queried over time.

#### Adding Data

To add data to the database, you create a transaction with the data you want to add:

```clojure
(def add-user
  [{:db/id       (d/tempid :db.part/user)
    :user/name   "Alice"
    :user/email  "alice@example.com"
    :user/age    30}])

;; Transact the data
@(d/transact conn {:tx-data add-user})
```

#### Updating Data

Updating data in Datomic involves retracting the old value and adding the new value:

```clojure
(def update-user
  [[:db/retractEntity [:user/email "alice@example.com"]]
   {:db/id       (d/tempid :db.part/user)
    :user/name   "Alice"
    :user/email  "alice@newdomain.com"
    :user/age    31}])

;; Transact the update
@(d/transact conn {:tx-data update-user})
```

#### Retracting Data

To remove data, you use the `:db.fn/retractEntity` function:

```clojure
(def retract-user
  [[:db.fn/retractEntity [:user/email "alice@newdomain.com"]]])

;; Transact the retraction
@(d/transact conn {:tx-data retract-user})
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of working with Datomic, try modifying the examples to add new attributes to the schema, perform more complex queries, or handle transactions with different data. Experimenting with these concepts will deepen your understanding of Datomic's capabilities.
