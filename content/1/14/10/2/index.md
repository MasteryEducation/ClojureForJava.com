## 14.10.2 Step-by-Step Tutorials

Welcome to the step-by-step tutorials section, where we dive into practical applications of Clojure for data handling. These tutorials are designed for experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, providing a hands-on approach to mastering data manipulation, transformation, and processing in a functional programming paradigm. We'll explore various projects, each accompanied by detailed explanations and code snippets to enhance your understanding.

### Tutorial 1: Building a Data Transformation Pipeline

**Objective**: Create a data transformation pipeline in Clojure that processes a list of customer records, filters out inactive customers, and formats the data for reporting.

#### Step 1: Define the Data Structure

In Clojure, we often use maps to represent structured data. Let's define a list of customer records:

```clojure
(def customers
  [{:id 1 :name "Alice" :active true :balance 1200.50}
   {:id 2 :name "Bob" :active false :balance 0.00}
   {:id 3 :name "Charlie" :active true :balance 300.75}])
```

**Explanation**: Each customer is represented as a map with keys for `id`, `name`, `active`, and `balance`.

#### Step 2: Filter Active Customers

We'll use the `filter` function to retain only active customers:

```clojure
(defn active-customers [customers]
  (filter :active customers))

(def active-customers-list (active-customers customers))
```

**Explanation**: The `filter` function takes a predicate and a collection, returning a new collection of items that satisfy the predicate. Here, `:active` is used as a shorthand for `(fn [customer] (:active customer))`.

#### Step 3: Format Customer Data

Next, we'll format the data for reporting using the `map` function:

```clojure
(defn format-customer [customer]
  (str (:name customer) " has a balance of $" (:balance customer)))

(def formatted-customers
  (map format-customer active-customers-list))
```

**Explanation**: The `map` function applies `format-customer` to each item in `active-customers-list`, transforming each map into a formatted string.

#### Step 4: Combine the Pipeline

Let's combine these steps into a single pipeline:

```clojure
(defn customer-report [customers]
  (->> customers
       (filter :active)
       (map format-customer)))

(def report (customer-report customers))
```

**Explanation**: The `->>` macro threads the collection through each function, creating a clear and readable pipeline.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment by adding more fields to the customer map, such as `:email` or `:last-purchase-date`, and modify the pipeline to include these in the report.

### Tutorial 2: JSON Data Processing

**Objective**: Parse JSON data, transform it, and serialize it back to JSON using Clojure.

#### Step 1: Parse JSON Data

We'll use the `cheshire` library to parse JSON data. First, add `cheshire` to your `project.clj` dependencies:

```clojure
[cheshire "5.10.0"]
```

Now, let's parse a JSON string:

```clojure
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])

(def json-str "{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"active\": true}")

(def parsed-data (json/parse-string json-str true))
```

**Explanation**: The `parse-string` function converts a JSON string into a Clojure map. The `true` argument indicates that keys should be converted to keywords.

#### Step 2: Transform the Data

Let's transform the data by updating the age:

```clojure
(defn update-age [data]
  (assoc data :age (+ (:age data) 1)))

(def updated-data (update-age parsed-data))
```

**Explanation**: The `assoc` function returns a new map with the specified key-value pair added or updated.

#### Step 3: Serialize Back to JSON

Finally, serialize the transformed data back to JSON:

```clojure
(def json-output (json/generate-string updated-data))

(println json-output)
```

**Explanation**: The `generate-string` function converts a Clojure map back into a JSON string.

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the JSON structure to include nested objects or arrays, and update the transformation logic to handle these structures.

### Tutorial 3: Interacting with a Database

**Objective**: Connect to a database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and handle transactions using Clojure.

#### Step 1: Set Up Database Connection

We'll use `clojure.java.jdbc` to interact with a database. Add it to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
```

Define the database connection:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec {:dbtype "h2" :dbname "testdb"})
```

**Explanation**: The `db-spec` map contains the database type and name. Here, we're using an H2 in-memory database for simplicity.

#### Step 2: Create a Table

Create a table to store customer data:

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! db-spec ["CREATE TABLE customers (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50), active BOOLEAN)"])
```

**Explanation**: The `execute!` function runs a SQL command against the database.

#### Step 3: Insert Data

Insert a new customer record:

```clojure
(jdbc/insert! db-spec :customers {:id 1 :name "Alice" :active true})
```

**Explanation**: The `insert!` function inserts a map of column-value pairs into the specified table.

#### Step 4: Query Data

Retrieve customer records:

```clojure
(def customers (jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM customers"]))

(println customers)
```

**Explanation**: The `query` function executes a SQL query and returns the results as a sequence of maps.

#### Step 5: Update Data

Update a customer's status:

```clojure
(jdbc/update! db-spec :customers {:active false} ["id=?" 1])
```

**Explanation**: The `update!` function updates records in the specified table based on a condition.

#### Step 6: Delete Data

Delete a customer record:

```clojure
(jdbc/delete! db-spec :customers ["id=?" 1])
```

**Explanation**: The `delete!` function removes records from the specified table based on a condition.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with different SQL commands and explore how transactions can be managed using `jdbc/with-db-transaction`.

### Tutorial 4: Real-Time Data Processing with core.async

**Objective**: Implement a real-time data processing system using Clojure's `core.async` library.

#### Step 1: Set Up core.async

Add `core.async` to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
[org.clojure/core.async "1.3.610"]
```

Require the necessary namespaces:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])
```

#### Step 2: Create Channels

Create channels for data flow:

```clojure
(def data-channel (async/chan))
(def processed-channel (async/chan))
```

**Explanation**: Channels are used to pass data between different parts of the system asynchronously.

#### Step 3: Implement Data Producer

Create a producer that sends data to the `data-channel`:

```clojure
(defn data-producer []
  (async/go
    (doseq [i (range 10)]
      (async/>! data-channel i)
      (Thread/sleep 1000))))
```

**Explanation**: The `go` block allows asynchronous operations. The `>!` operator sends data to a channel.

#### Step 4: Implement Data Processor

Create a processor that reads from `data-channel`, processes the data, and sends it to `processed-channel`:

```clojure
(defn data-processor []
  (async/go
    (while true
      (let [data (async/<! data-channel)]
        (async/>! processed-channel (* data 2))))))
```

**Explanation**: The `<!` operator reads data from a channel. Here, we double the data before sending it to `processed-channel`.

#### Step 5: Implement Data Consumer

Create a consumer that reads from `processed-channel` and prints the results:

```clojure
(defn data-consumer []
  (async/go
    (while true
      (let [data (async/<! processed-channel)]
        (println "Processed data:" data)))))
```

**Explanation**: The consumer continuously reads from `processed-channel` and prints each piece of processed data.

#### Step 6: Run the System

Start the producer, processor, and consumer:

```clojure
(data-producer)
(data-processor)
(data-consumer)
```

**Explanation**: These functions run concurrently, demonstrating real-time data processing.

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the system to include error handling or introduce additional processing steps, such as filtering or aggregating data.

### Summary and Key Takeaways
