## 12.1.2 Common Leiningen Commands

Leiningen is a powerful build automation tool specifically designed for Clojure projects. It simplifies many aspects of project management, from creating new projects to running applications and executing tests. In this section, we will delve into some of the most commonly used Leiningen commands, providing you with the knowledge to efficiently manage your Clojure development workflow.

### Introduction to Leiningen

Before we dive into specific commands, it's essential to understand what Leiningen is and why it's a preferred tool among Clojure developers. Leiningen automates tasks like project setup, dependency management, and build processes, allowing developers to focus more on coding and less on configuration. It is similar in spirit to tools like Maven or Gradle in the Java ecosystem but tailored to the needs of Clojure.

### Creating a New Project with `lein new`

The `lein new` command is the starting point for any Clojure project. It scaffolds a new project directory with a predefined structure, which includes directories for source code, tests, and configuration files. This command is crucial for setting up a consistent and organized project layout.

#### Basic Usage

To create a new Clojure project, you can use the following command:

```bash
lein new app my-awesome-app
```

This command creates a new application project named `my-awesome-app`. The `app` template is one of the most commonly used templates, suitable for building standalone applications. The project structure will look like this:

```
my-awesome-app/
├── README.md
├── doc/
├── project.clj
├── resources/
├── src/
│   └── my_awesome_app/
│       └── core.clj
├── target/
└── test/
    └── my_awesome_app/
        └── core_test.clj
```

#### Customizing Project Templates

Leiningen supports various templates that can be used to scaffold different types of projects. For instance, if you're interested in creating a web application, you might use a template like `compojure`:

```bash
lein new compojure my-web-app
```

This command will create a project with the necessary setup for a web application using the Compojure framework.

#### Advanced Template Options

Leiningen also allows you to create custom templates or use community-contributed templates. You can find a list of available templates on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) or by searching online repositories. To use a custom template, you can specify it as follows:

```bash
lein new template-name my-custom-project
```

### Running Your Application with `lein run`

Once your project is set up, the next step is to run your application. The `lein run` command is used to execute the main entry point of your application, typically defined in the `project.clj` file.

#### Basic Usage

To run your application, simply navigate to your project directory and execute:

```bash
lein run
```

This command compiles your source code and runs the `-main` function defined in your project. By default, Leiningen looks for the `-main` function in the namespace specified in the `:main` key of your `project.clj` file.

#### Passing Arguments

You can also pass command-line arguments to your application using `lein run`. For example:

```bash
lein run arg1 arg2
```

In your Clojure code, you can access these arguments via the `*command-line-args*` variable.

#### Running Specific Namespaces

If your project contains multiple entry points, you can specify which namespace to run:

```bash
lein run -m my-awesome-app.core
```

This command explicitly runs the `-main` function in the `my-awesome-app.core` namespace.

### Testing Your Code with `lein test`

Testing is a critical part of software development, and Leiningen makes it easy to run tests with the `lein test` command. This command automatically discovers and executes all test namespaces in your project.

#### Basic Usage

To run all tests in your project, simply execute:

```bash
lein test
```

Leiningen will search for test files in the `test` directory and execute any functions prefixed with `test-`.

#### Running Specific Tests

You can target specific test namespaces or functions by providing their names:

```bash
lein test my-awesome-app.core-test
```

This command runs all tests in the `my-awesome-app.core-test` namespace.

#### Test Reporting

Leiningen provides detailed test reports, including information about passed, failed, and skipped tests. You can also integrate with third-party test reporters for more advanced reporting features.

### Additional Leiningen Commands

While `lein new`, `lein run`, and `lein test` are among the most commonly used commands, Leiningen offers a wide range of other commands to support various aspects of project management.

#### `lein deps`

This command resolves and downloads all project dependencies specified in the `project.clj` file. It's useful when you add new dependencies or want to ensure all dependencies are up to date.

```bash
lein deps
```

#### `lein uberjar`

The `lein uberjar` command creates a standalone JAR file containing your application and all its dependencies. This JAR can be distributed and run on any machine with a Java runtime.

```bash
lein uberjar
```

#### `lein clean`

To remove compiled files and reset your project to a clean state, use the `lein clean` command. This is particularly useful if you encounter issues with stale compiled code.

```bash
lein clean
```

### Best Practices and Tips

- **Consistent Project Structure:** Always use `lein new` to create projects to ensure a consistent structure, which helps in maintaining and scaling projects.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly run `lein deps` to keep your dependencies updated and avoid potential conflicts.
- **Automated Testing:** Integrate `lein test` into your continuous integration pipeline to ensure code quality and catch issues early.
- **Documentation:** Use the `README.md` file generated by `lein new` to document your project, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the project setup and usage.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Incorrect `project.clj` Configuration:** Ensure that your `project.clj` file is correctly configured, especially the `:main` and `:dependencies` keys, to avoid runtime errors.
- **Stale Dependencies:** Regularly update your dependencies to benefit from bug fixes and new features.
- **Ignoring Test Failures:** Always address test failures promptly to maintain code quality and prevent regression.

### Conclusion

Leiningen is an indispensable tool for Clojure developers, offering a comprehensive suite of commands to streamline the development process. By mastering commands like `lein new`, `lein run`, and `lein test`, you can significantly enhance your productivity and ensure your projects are well-structured and maintainable. As you continue to explore the capabilities of Leiningen, you'll find it to be a robust ally in your Clojure development journey.
