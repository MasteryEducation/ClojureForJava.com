## 12.7.3 Use Cases

Event-driven architectures (EDA) are a powerful paradigm for building systems that respond to events or changes in state. In this section, we will explore various use cases for event-driven architectures in Clojure, focusing on real-time data processing, GUI applications, and microservices communication. By leveraging Clojure's functional programming capabilities and its robust concurrency primitives, developers can build scalable and responsive systems.

### Real-Time Data Processing

Real-time data processing involves handling data as it is produced, allowing for immediate insights and actions. This is crucial in industries such as finance, telecommunications, and e-commerce, where timely data processing can lead to competitive advantages.

#### Clojure's Strengths in Real-Time Processing

Clojure's immutable data structures and concurrency primitives make it well-suited for real-time data processing. The language's emphasis on immutability ensures that data can be safely shared across threads without the risk of race conditions, a common challenge in real-time systems.

**Example: Real-Time Stock Price Monitoring**

Let's consider a real-time stock price monitoring system. In this system, stock prices are streamed from a data source, and the application needs to process and display these prices in real-time.

```clojure
(ns stock-monitor.core
  (:require [clojure.core.async :as async]))

(defn process-stock-price [price]
  ;; Process the stock price, e.g., update a dashboard
  (println "Processing stock price:" price))

(defn start-monitoring [price-channel]
  (async/go-loop []
    (when-let [price (async/<! price-channel)]
      (process-stock-price price)
      (recur))))

(defn simulate-stock-price-stream [price-channel]
  (async/go-loop []
    (async/>! price-channel (rand-int 1000)) ;; Simulate a random stock price
    (async/<! (async/timeout 1000)) ;; Wait for 1 second
    (recur)))

(let [price-channel (async/chan)]
  (simulate-stock-price-stream price-channel)
  (start-monitoring price-channel))
```

In this example, we use Clojure's `core.async` library to create a channel for streaming stock prices. The `simulate-stock-price-stream` function simulates a data source by generating random stock prices and sending them to the channel. The `start-monitoring` function processes each price as it arrives.

### GUI Applications

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are inherently event-driven, responding to user actions such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements. Clojure's functional approach and libraries like Reagent and Re-frame make it an excellent choice for building responsive and maintainable GUIs.

#### Building GUIs with Reagent and Re-frame

Reagent is a ClojureScript interface to React, allowing developers to build dynamic user interfaces using Clojure's functional programming model. Re-frame builds on Reagent, providing a framework for managing state and events in a structured way.

**Example: Simple Counter Application**

Let's build a simple counter application using Reagent and Re-frame.

```clojure
(ns counter.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]))

;; Define the app's state
(rf/reg-event-db
 :initialize
 (fn [_ _]
   {:count 0}))

;; Define an event to increment the counter
(rf/reg-event-db
 :increment
 (fn [db _]
   (update db :count inc)))

;; Define a subscription to access the counter value
(rf/reg-sub
 :count
 (fn [db _]
   (:count db)))

;; Define the main component
(defn counter []
  (let [count (rf/subscribe [:count])]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:h1 "Counter: " @count]
       [:button {:on-click #(rf/dispatch [:increment])} "Increment"]])))

;; Initialize the app
(defn init []
  (rf/dispatch-sync [:initialize])
  (r/render [counter] (.getElementById js/document "app")))
```

In this example, we define a simple counter application. The application state is managed using Re-frame's event and subscription system. The `counter` component displays the current count and provides a button to increment it.

```

### Microservices Communication

Microservices architecture involves building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services. These services often communicate via events, making event-driven architectures a natural fit.

#### Event-Driven Microservices

In a microservices architecture, services can communicate through events using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. This decouples services, allowing them to evolve independently and scale more easily.

**Example: Order Processing System**

Consider an order processing system where different services handle order creation, payment processing, and shipping.

```clojure
(ns order-processing.core
  (:require [clojure.core.async :as async]))

(defn process-order [order]
  ;; Process the order, e.g., validate and save to database
  (println "Processing order:" order))

(defn start-order-service [order-channel]
  (async/go-loop []
    (when-let [order (async/<! order-channel)]
      (process-order order)
      (recur))))

(defn simulate-order-stream [order-channel]
  (async/go-loop []
    (async/>! order-channel {:id (rand-int 1000) :item "Widget"})
    (async/<! (async/timeout 5000)) ;; Wait for 5 seconds
    (recur)))

(let [order-channel (async/chan)]
  (simulate-order-stream order-channel)
  (start-order-service order-channel))
```

In this example, we simulate an order stream using a channel. The `start-order-service` function processes each order as it arrives, demonstrating how services can handle events asynchronously.

    B -->|Event| C[Shipping Service]
    C -->|Event| D[Notification Service]
```
