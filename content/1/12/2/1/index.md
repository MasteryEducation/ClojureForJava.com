## 12.2.1 Understanding the Strategy Pattern

In the realm of software design, the **Strategy Pattern** is a powerful tool that allows developers to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to select an algorithm's behavior at runtime. In this section, we'll explore how the Strategy Pattern is traditionally implemented in object-oriented programming (OOP) with Java and how it can be adapted to functional programming using Clojure.

### The Strategy Pattern in Java

In Java, the Strategy Pattern is typically implemented using interfaces and classes. The pattern involves defining a strategy interface that declares a method for executing an algorithm. Concrete strategy classes implement this interface, providing specific algorithm implementations. The context class maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the algorithm execution to the strategy object.

#### Java Example: Strategy Pattern

Let's consider a simple example where we have different strategies for sorting a list of integers.

```java
// Strategy interface
interface SortStrategy {
    void sort(int[] numbers);
}

// Concrete strategy for bubble sort
class BubbleSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        // Bubble sort implementation
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < numbers.length - i - 1; j++) {
                if (numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = numbers[j];
                    numbers[j] = numbers[j + 1];
                    numbers[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Concrete strategy for quick sort
class QuickSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
        // Quick sort implementation
        quickSort(numbers, 0, numbers.length - 1);
    }

    private void quickSort(int[] numbers, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(numbers, low, high);
            quickSort(numbers, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(numbers, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    private int partition(int[] numbers, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = numbers[high];
        int i = (low - 1);
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (numbers[j] <= pivot) {
                i++;
                int temp = numbers[i];
                numbers[i] = numbers[j];
                numbers[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        int temp = numbers[i + 1];
        numbers[i + 1] = numbers[high];
        numbers[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }
}

// Context class
class SortContext {
    private SortStrategy strategy;

    public SortContext(SortStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(SortStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executeStrategy(int[] numbers) {
        strategy.sort(numbers);
    }
}
```

In this example, `SortStrategy` is the strategy interface, `BubbleSortStrategy` and `QuickSortStrategy` are concrete strategies, and `SortContext` is the context class that uses a strategy to sort numbers.

### The Strategy Pattern in Clojure

In Clojure, we can leverage the power of **higher-order functions** to implement the Strategy Pattern. Instead of creating multiple classes, we define functions for each strategy and pass them as arguments to other functions. This approach aligns with Clojure's functional programming paradigm, where functions are first-class citizens.

#### Clojure Example: Strategy Pattern

Let's translate the Java example into Clojure.

```clojure
;; Define a function for bubble sort
(defn bubble-sort [numbers]
  (let [n (count numbers)]
    (loop [i 0
           nums numbers]
      (if (< i (dec n))
        (recur (inc i)
               (loop [j 0
                      nums nums]
                 (if (< j (- n i 1))
                   (if (> (nums j) (nums (inc j)))
                     (recur (inc j) (assoc nums j (nums (inc j)) (inc j) (nums j)))
                     (recur (inc j) nums))
                   nums)))
        nums))))

;; Define a function for quick sort
(defn quick-sort [numbers]
  (if (empty? numbers)
    numbers
    (let [pivot (first numbers)
          rest (rest numbers)]
      (concat
       (quick-sort (filter #(<= % pivot) rest))
       [pivot]
       (quick-sort (filter #(> % pivot) rest))))))

;; Context function that takes a sorting strategy
(defn sort-numbers [strategy numbers]
  (strategy numbers))

;; Usage
(def numbers [5 3 8 6 2])

;; Using bubble sort strategy
(println "Bubble Sort:" (sort-numbers bubble-sort numbers))

;; Using quick sort strategy
(println "Quick Sort:" (sort-numbers quick-sort numbers))
```

In this Clojure example, `bubble-sort` and `quick-sort` are functions that implement different sorting algorithms. The `sort-numbers` function acts as the context, taking a strategy function and a list of numbers to sort.

### Comparing Java and Clojure Implementations

The Java implementation of the Strategy Pattern relies on interfaces and classes to encapsulate algorithms, while the Clojure implementation uses functions. This difference highlights a key advantage of functional programming: **simplicity and flexibility**. In Clojure, we can easily switch strategies by passing different functions, without the need for additional classes or interfaces.

#### Key Differences:

- **Encapsulation**: In Java, algorithms are encapsulated within classes, whereas in Clojure, they are encapsulated within functions.
- **Flexibility**: Clojure's approach allows for more flexible and concise code, as functions can be easily passed around and composed.
- **Boilerplate**: Java requires more boilerplate code to define interfaces and classes, while Clojure's functional approach reduces boilerplate significantly.

### Advantages of the Strategy Pattern in Clojure

1. **Code Reusability**: By defining algorithms as functions, we can easily reuse them across different parts of our application.
2. **Interchangeability**: Functions can be passed as arguments, allowing us to change behavior at runtime without modifying existing code.
3. **Simplicity**: Clojure's functional approach simplifies the implementation of design patterns, reducing complexity and improving readability.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Strategy Pattern in Clojure, try modifying the code examples:

- Implement a new sorting strategy, such as merge sort, and integrate it into the `sort-numbers` function.
- Experiment with different data structures, such as vectors or lists, and observe how the sorting algorithms behave.
- Create a new context function that applies multiple strategies in sequence, such as sorting and then filtering the numbers.

### Diagram: Strategy Pattern Flow in Clojure

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of data through the Strategy Pattern in Clojure, using higher-order functions.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Numbers] --> B[Context Function: sort-numbers];
    B --> C[Strategy Function: bubble-sort];
    B --> D[Strategy Function: quick-sort];
    C --> E[Sorted Numbers];
    D --> E[Sorted Numbers];
```

*Diagram Caption*: This diagram shows how the `sort-numbers` function acts as a context, taking an input list of numbers and a strategy function (either `bubble-sort` or `quick-sort`) to produce sorted numbers.
