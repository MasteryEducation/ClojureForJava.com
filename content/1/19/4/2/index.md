## 19.4.2 Setting Up the ClojureScript Environment

As experienced Java developers, you're likely familiar with setting up environments for Java applications. Transitioning to ClojureScript, a powerful tool for building modern web applications, involves setting up a development environment that supports live reloading and efficient builds. In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a ClojureScript environment using tools like **Figwheel Main** and **Shadow CLJS**. These tools streamline the development process by providing live reloading, hot code swapping, and efficient build processes.

### Understanding ClojureScript

ClojureScript is a variant of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript, allowing you to write Clojure code that runs in the browser. It leverages the power of functional programming and immutability, offering a robust alternative to JavaScript for frontend development. ClojureScript integrates seamlessly with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile choice for web applications.

### Key Tools for ClojureScript Development

Before diving into the setup, let's explore the key tools we'll be using:

- **Leiningen**: A build automation tool for Clojure projects, similar to Maven or Gradle in Java.
- **Figwheel Main**: Provides live reloading of ClojureScript code, enabling a smooth development experience.
- **Shadow CLJS**: A build tool that simplifies the process of compiling ClojureScript, offering advanced features like module splitting and npm integration.

### Setting Up Your ClojureScript Environment

#### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure that you have Java installed on your system, as ClojureScript relies on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). You can verify your Java installation by running:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java is not installed, download and install it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

#### Step 2: Install Leiningen

Leiningen is essential for managing Clojure projects. Install it by following these steps:

1. **Download the Leiningen script**:
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -o /usr/local/bin/lein
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lein
   ```

3. **Run Leiningen** to download dependencies:
   ```bash
   lein
   ```

#### Step 3: Create a New ClojureScript Project

Use Leiningen to create a new ClojureScript project. We'll use Figwheel Main for live reloading:

```bash
lein new figwheel-main my-clojurescript-app -- --reagent
```

This command creates a new project named `my-clojurescript-app` with Reagent, a minimalistic React wrapper for ClojureScript.

#### Step 4: Configure Figwheel Main

Navigate to your project directory and open the `deps.edn` file. Add the following configuration to enable Figwheel Main:

```clojure
{:paths ["src" "resources"]
 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.844"}
        com.bhauman/figwheel-main {:mvn/version "0.2.14"}
        reagent {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}}
 :aliases {:fig {:main-opts ["-m" "figwheel.main" "-b" "dev" "-r"]}}}
```

This configuration specifies the paths, dependencies, and aliases for running Figwheel Main.

#### Step 5: Run Figwheel Main

Start the Figwheel Main server to enable live reloading:

```bash
clojure -A:fig
```

This command compiles your ClojureScript code and opens a browser window with live reloading enabled. Any changes you make to your code will automatically reflect in the browser.

#### Step 6: Install Shadow CLJS (Optional)

Shadow CLJS is an alternative to Figwheel Main, offering advanced features like npm integration. To install Shadow CLJS, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Shadow CLJS requires Node.js. Download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Shadow CLJS globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g shadow-cljs
   ```

3. **Create a Shadow CLJS configuration file**: In your project directory, create a `shadow-cljs.edn` file with the following content:

   ```clojure
   {:source-paths ["src"]
    :dependencies [[reagent "1.1.0"]]
    :builds {:app {:target :browser
                   :output-dir "public/js"
                   :asset-path "/js"
                   :modules {:main {:entries [my-clojurescript-app.core]}}}}}
   ```

4. **Run Shadow CLJS**:
   ```bash
   shadow-cljs watch app
   ```

This command compiles your ClojureScript code and watches for changes, providing live reloading.

### Comparing Figwheel Main and Shadow CLJS

Both Figwheel Main and Shadow CLJS offer live reloading and efficient builds, but they have distinct features:

- **Figwheel Main**: Ideal for projects that prioritize simplicity and quick setup. It integrates seamlessly with Leiningen and is well-suited for smaller projects.
- **Shadow CLJS**: Offers advanced features like npm integration, module splitting, and better support for large-scale applications. It's a great choice for projects that require complex build configurations.

### Code Example: A Simple ClojureScript Component

Let's create a simple ClojureScript component using Reagent. Open the `src/my_clojurescript_app/core.cljs` file and add the following code:

```clojure
(ns my-clojurescript-app.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]))

(defn hello-world []
  [:div
   [:h1 "Hello, ClojureScript!"]
   [:p "This is a simple Reagent component."]])

(defn mount-root []
  (r/render [hello-world]
            (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(defn init []
  (mount-root))
```

This code defines a simple Reagent component that displays a greeting message. The `init` function mounts the component to the DOM element with the ID `app`.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code by modifying the `hello-world` function to display different messages or add new HTML elements. Observe how Figwheel Main or Shadow CLJS automatically reloads the changes in your browser.

### Diagram: ClojureScript Development Workflow

Below is a diagram illustrating the ClojureScript development workflow using Figwheel Main or Shadow CLJS:

```mermaid

```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart represents the iterative development process in ClojureScript, where code edits are compiled and live-reloaded in the browser.

### Exercises

1. **Create a New Component**: Extend the example by creating a new Reagent component that displays a list of items. Use a vector to represent the list and map over it to generate HTML elements.

2. **Integrate a JavaScript Library**: Use Shadow CLJS to integrate a popular JavaScript library, such as Lodash or Moment.js, into your ClojureScript project. Create a component that utilizes the library's functionality.

3. **Explore Module Splitting**: With Shadow CLJS, experiment with module splitting by creating multiple entry points in your application. Observe how this affects the build process and application performance.
