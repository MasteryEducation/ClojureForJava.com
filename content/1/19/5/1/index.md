## 19.5.1 Connecting Frontend and Backend

In the world of full-stack development, integrating the frontend and backend components of an application is crucial for creating a seamless user experience. This section will guide you through the process of connecting these components in a Clojure-based application, focusing on strategies for effective integration, configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and coordinating API endpoints with frontend requests. We'll leverage your existing Java knowledge to highlight similarities and differences, ensuring a smooth transition to Clojure.

### Understanding the Integration Process

Connecting the frontend and backend involves several key steps:

1. **Defining API Endpoints**: Establishing clear and consistent API endpoints that the frontend can interact with.
2. **Handling CORS**: Configuring CORS to allow the frontend to communicate with the backend across different origins.
3. **Data Serialization**: Ensuring data is correctly serialized and deserialized between the frontend and backend.
4. **State Management**: Managing application state across the frontend and backend.
5. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling to manage communication failures.

Let's dive into each of these components in detail.

### Defining API Endpoints

API endpoints are the bridge between your frontend and backend. They define how the frontend can interact with the backend, typically through HTTP requests. In Clojure, we often use libraries like **Compojure** or **Reitit** to define these endpoints.

#### Example: Defining API Endpoints with Compojure

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/api/data" [] "Hello, World!") ; Define a simple GET endpoint
  (POST "/api/data" req (str "Received: " (:body req))) ; Define a POST endpoint
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000}))
```

**Explanation**: This code snippet defines a simple web server with two endpoints: a GET endpoint that returns a "Hello, World!" message and a POST endpoint that echoes the received data. The `run-jetty` function starts the server on port 3000.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, you might use a framework like Spring Boot to define similar endpoints:

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/api/data")
    public String getData() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    @PostMapping("/api/data")
    public String postData(@RequestBody String body) {
        return "Received: " + body;
    }
}
```

**Key Differences**: Clojure's syntax is more concise, and the use of higher-order functions allows for more flexible routing logic.

### Handling CORS

CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. To enable CORS in a Clojure application, we can use middleware to add the necessary headers to our HTTP responses.

#### Example: Configuring CORS in Clojure

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware
  (:require [ring.middleware.cors :refer [wrap-cors]]))

(defn wrap-my-cors [handler]
  (wrap-cors handler
             :access-control-allow-origin [#"http://localhost:3000"]
             :access-control-allow-methods [:get :post :put :delete]
             :access-control-allow-headers ["Content-Type"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `wrap-cors` middleware is used to specify which origins are allowed to access the server, along with the allowed HTTP methods and headers.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, CORS configuration might look like this using Spring Boot:

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/api/**")
                .allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000")
                .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE")
                .allowedHeaders("Content-Type");
    }
}
```

**Key Differences**: Both Clojure and Java provide flexible ways to configure CORS, but Clojure's use of middleware allows for more composable and reusable configurations.

### Data Serialization

Data serialization is the process of converting data into a format that can be easily transmitted and reconstructed. JSON is a common format used for this purpose in web applications.

#### Example: Serializing Data in Clojure

```clojure
(ns myapp.util
  (:require [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn serialize-data [data]
  (json/generate-string data))

(defn deserialize-data [json-str]
  (json/parse-string json-str true))
```

**Explanation**: The `cheshire` library is used to convert Clojure data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.

#### Comparison with Java

In Java, you might use a library like Jackson for JSON serialization:

```java
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

String jsonString = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(data);
Map<String, Object> data = objectMapper.readValue(jsonString, Map.class);
```

**Key Differences**: Clojure's dynamic typing and data structures make serialization straightforward, while Java requires explicit type handling.

### State Management

Managing state across the frontend and backend is crucial for maintaining a consistent user experience. In Clojure, we often use atoms, refs, or agents to manage state on the backend, while libraries like Re-frame are used on the frontend.

#### Example: Managing State with Atoms

```clojure
(ns myapp.state)

(def app-state (atom {:count 0}))

(defn increment-count []
  (swap! app-state update :count inc))
```

**Explanation**: An atom is used to hold the application state, and the `swap!` function is used to update it.

### Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential for managing communication failures between the frontend and backend. In Clojure, we can use middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully.

#### Example: Error Handling Middleware

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware
  (:require [ring.util.response :refer [response]]))

(defn wrap-error-handler [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (try
      (handler request)
      (catch Exception e
        (response {:status 500 :body "Internal Server Error"})))))
```

**Explanation**: This middleware catches exceptions and returns a 500 error response.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, try modifying the code examples to:

- Add additional API endpoints for different HTTP methods.
- Configure CORS to allow multiple origins.
- Implement custom error messages for different exceptions.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

Connecting the frontend and backend in a Clojure application involves defining clear API endpoints, configuring CORS, managing data serialization, handling state, and implementing robust error handling. By leveraging Clojure's powerful features and drawing parallels with Java, you can create a seamless and efficient full-stack application.
