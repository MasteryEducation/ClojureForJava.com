## 19.5.2 Shared Code and Namespaces

In the world of full-stack development, sharing code between the frontend and backend can significantly enhance consistency and reduce redundancy. Clojure, with its unique approach to functional programming and its seamless integration with ClojureScript, offers a powerful mechanism for sharing code across the stack using **namespaces** and **.cljc files**. In this section, we will explore these concepts in depth, providing you with the knowledge to efficiently manage shared code in your Clojure applications.

### Understanding Namespaces in Clojure

Namespaces in Clojure are akin to packages in Java. They provide a way to organize code and avoid naming conflicts. In Clojure, a namespace is a mapping from symbols to values, which can include functions, variables, and other data structures.

#### Creating and Using Namespaces

To define a namespace in Clojure, you use the `ns` macro. Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core)

(defn greet [name]
  (str "Hello, " name "!"))
```

In this example, `myapp.core` is the namespace, and `greet` is a function defined within it. You can refer to this function from another namespace using the `require` or `use` keywords.

```clojure
(ns myapp.user
  (:require [myapp.core :as core]))

(core/greet "Alice") ; => "Hello, Alice!"
```

#### Comparing with Java Packages

In Java, packages are used to group related classes and interfaces. A typical Java package declaration looks like this:

```java
package com.example.myapp;

public class Greeter {
    public static String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
```

To use this class in another package, you would import it:

```java
import com.example.myapp.Greeter;

public class User {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Greeter.greet("Alice"));
    }
}
```

Both Clojure namespaces and Java packages serve the purpose of organizing code and preventing naming conflicts, but Clojure's approach is more dynamic, allowing for runtime modifications and more flexible code sharing.

### Sharing Code with .cljc Files

Clojure introduces `.cljc` files to facilitate code sharing between Clojure and ClojureScript. These files can be compiled for both environments, making them ideal for shared logic such as data models, validation functions, and utility libraries.

#### Creating a .cljc File

Let's create a simple `.cljc` file to define a shared data model:

```clojure
(ns myapp.shared.model)

(defrecord User [id name email])

(defn valid-email? [email]
  (re-matches #".+@.+\..+" email))
```

In this example, we define a `User` record and a `valid-email?` function to validate email addresses. This code can be used in both Clojure and ClojureScript environments.

#### Using .cljc Files in Clojure and ClojureScript

To use the shared code in a Clojure backend, you simply require the namespace:

```clojure
(ns myapp.backend.core
  (:require [myapp.shared.model :as model]))

(defn create-user [id name email]
  (when (model/valid-email? email)
    (model/User. id name email)))
```

In a ClojureScript frontend, the process is similar:

```clojure
(ns myapp.frontend.core
  (:require [myapp.shared.model :as model]))

(defn display-user [user]
  (println "User:" (:name user) "Email:" (:email user)))
```

#### Conditional Compilation with Reader Conditionals

Clojure provides reader conditionals to handle platform-specific code within `.cljc` files. This allows you to include code that should only be executed in a specific environment.

```clojure
(ns myapp.shared.utils)

(defn platform-specific-function []
  #?(:clj  (println "Running on Clojure")
     :cljs (println "Running on ClojureScript")))
```

In this example, the `platform-specific-function` will print different messages depending on whether it's executed in a Clojure or ClojureScript environment.

### Best Practices for Shared Code

When sharing code between the frontend and backend, it's important to follow best practices to ensure maintainability and performance.

#### Keep Shared Code Pure

Shared code should be as pure as possible, meaning it should avoid side effects and rely solely on its inputs to produce outputs. This makes the code easier to test and reuse across different parts of your application.

#### Use Namespaces to Organize Shared Code

Organize your shared code into logical namespaces that reflect its purpose. This makes it easier to find and use the code you need, and it helps prevent naming conflicts.

#### Leverage Reader Conditionals Sparingly

While reader conditionals are powerful, they can make your code harder to read and maintain. Use them sparingly and only when necessary to handle platform-specific differences.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with shared code and namespaces, try modifying the examples above:

1. **Add a new field** to the `User` record and update the `create-user` and `display-user` functions to handle it.
2. **Implement additional validation functions** in the `.cljc` file and use them in both the backend and frontend.
3. **Experiment with reader conditionals** to see how they affect the behavior of your code in different environments.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

To better understand how namespaces and shared code work in Clojure, let's look at a diagram illustrating the flow of data and code organization:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Shared Code (.cljc)] -->|Require| B[Backend (Clojure)];
    A -->|Require| C[Frontend (ClojureScript)];
    B -->|Use| D[Backend Logic];
    C -->|Use| E[Frontend Logic];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram shows how shared code in a `.cljc` file is required by both the backend and frontend, allowing for consistent logic across the stack.

- [ClojureScript Documentation](https://clojurescript.org/)
- [ClojureDocs](https://clojuredocs.org/)

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Create a Shared Utility Library**: Develop a `.cljc` file containing utility functions that can be used across your application. Include functions for string manipulation, data transformation, and more.

2. **Implement a Shared Data Model**: Define a complex data model in a `.cljc` file and use it in both the backend and frontend. Ensure that all fields are validated and that the model is easy to extend.

3. **Refactor Existing Code**: Identify code in your application that could be shared between the frontend and backend. Move this code into a `.cljc` file and update your namespaces accordingly.

### Key Takeaways

- **Namespaces** in Clojure are similar to Java packages and are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts.
- **.cljc files** enable code sharing between Clojure and ClojureScript, making them ideal for shared logic like data models and validation functions.
- **Reader conditionals** allow for platform-specific code within `.cljc` files, but should be used sparingly to maintain readability.
- **Best practices** for shared code include keeping it pure, organizing it into logical namespaces, and using reader conditionals only when necessary.

By understanding and applying these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to manage shared code in your Clojure full-stack applications, leading to more consistent and maintainable codebases.
