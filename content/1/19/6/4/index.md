## 19.6.4 Continuous Integration Setup

Continuous Integration (CI) is a critical practice in modern software development, enabling teams to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. For Clojure developers, setting up a CI pipeline can streamline workflows, reduce errors, and ensure that code changes are integrated smoothly. In this section, we'll explore how to set up a CI pipeline for Clojure applications using popular tools like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, and Jenkins.

### Understanding Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, ideally several times a day. Each integration is verified by an automated build and test process, allowing teams to detect problems early.

#### Key Benefits of CI

- **Early Detection of Errors**: Automated testing helps catch bugs as soon as they are introduced.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Frequent integrations encourage collaboration and reduce integration conflicts.
- **Faster Feedback**: Developers receive immediate feedback on the impact of their changes.
- **Consistent Builds**: Automated builds ensure consistency across different environments.

### Setting Up a CI Pipeline

A CI pipeline typically involves the following steps:

1. **Code Checkout**: The CI server checks out the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build**: The application is built using a build tool like Leiningen or tools.deps.
3. **Test**: Automated tests are executed to verify the code's correctness.
4. **Deploy**: The application is deployed to a staging or production environment.

Let's explore how to implement these steps using different CI tools.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform that allows you to automate workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

#### Setting Up GitHub Actions for Clojure

1. **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

```yaml
name: Clojure CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '11'

    - name: Install Clojure
      run: |
        curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh
        chmod +x linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh
        sudo ./linux-install-1.10.3.967.sh

    - name: Build with Leiningen
      run: lein deps

    - name: Run tests
      run: lein test
```

**Explanation**:
- **Checkout Code**: Uses the `actions/checkout` action to pull the latest code.
- **Set up JDK**: Installs Java 11, which is required for running Clojure.
- **Install Clojure**: Downloads and installs Clojure.
- **Build and Test**: Uses Leiningen to install dependencies and run tests.

#### Advantages of GitHub Actions

- **Integrated with GitHub**: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define workflows using YAML files.
- **Community Support**: Access to a wide range of pre-built actions.

### Travis CI

Travis CI is a popular CI service that integrates with GitHub and offers a simple setup for open-source projects.

#### Setting Up Travis CI for Clojure

1. **Create a `.travis.yml` File**: Add the following configuration to your repository.

```yaml
language: clojure
jdk:
  - openjdk11

script:
  - lein deps
  - lein test
```

**Explanation**:
- **Language**: Specifies Clojure as the programming language.
- **JDK**: Uses OpenJDK 11.
- **Script**: Defines the build and test commands.

#### Advantages of Travis CI

- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required.
- **Free for Open Source**: Free for public repositories.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples.

### Jenkins

Jenkins is a widely-used open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project.

#### Setting Up Jenkins for Clojure

1. **Install Jenkins**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to set up Jenkins on your server.

2. **Create a New Job**: In Jenkins, create a new Freestyle project.

3. **Configure Source Code Management**: Connect your GitHub repository.

4. **Add Build Steps**:
   - **Execute Shell**: Add a shell script to build and test your application.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Install dependencies
lein deps

# Run tests
lein test
```

#### Advantages of Jenkins

- **Highly Customizable**: Extensive plugin ecosystem.
- **Self-Hosted**: Full control over the CI environment.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for large projects and teams.

### Comparing CI Tools

| Feature            | GitHub Actions | Travis CI | Jenkins       |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Integration**    | GitHub         | GitHub    | Any SCM       |
| **Customization**  | High           | Medium    | Very High     |
| **Ease of Use**    | Easy           | Easy      | Moderate      |
| **Cost**           | Free for public repos | Free for public repos | Free, self-hosted |

### Best Practices for CI in Clojure

- **Keep Builds Fast**: Optimize build and test times to provide quick feedback.
- **Use Caching**: Cache dependencies to speed up builds.
- **Run Tests in Parallel**: Leverage parallel test execution to reduce build times.
- **Monitor Build Health**: Regularly review build logs and address failures promptly.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the CI setup by modifying the workflow files:

- **Add a Deployment Step**: Extend the CI pipeline to deploy the application to a cloud provider.
- **Integrate with Slack**: Set up notifications to alert your team of build status changes.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

Setting up a CI pipeline for Clojure applications can significantly enhance your development workflow. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, you can ensure that your code is always in a deployable state. Whether you choose GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins, each tool offers unique advantages that can be tailored to your project's needs.

### Exercises

1. **Set up a CI pipeline** for a sample Clojure project using GitHub Actions. Ensure that the pipeline runs tests on every push to the main branch.
2. **Extend the Travis CI configuration** to include a deployment step that pushes the application to a staging environment.
3. **Configure Jenkins** to build and test a Clojure project, and set up email notifications for build failures.

By mastering CI tools and practices, you'll be well-equipped to maintain high-quality Clojure applications and collaborate effectively with your team.
