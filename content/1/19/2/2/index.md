## 19.2.2 RESTful API Design

In this section, we will delve into the design of RESTful APIs using Clojure, a powerful functional programming language that offers unique advantages for building robust and scalable web services. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with RESTful principles, but we will explore how Clojure's features can enhance your API design process. We'll cover the core principles of REST, the use of HTTP methods, status codes, and provide practical examples of API endpoints. Additionally, we'll discuss how to document your API effectively using tools like Swagger.

### Understanding RESTful Principles

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services. RESTful APIs are designed to be stateless, cacheable, and uniform, providing a standardized way for clients to interact with server resources.

#### Key Principles of REST

1. **Resource Identification through URLs**: In REST, resources are identified by URLs. Each resource should have a unique URL that represents it. For example, in a library system, a book resource might be identified by `/books/{id}`.

2. **Stateless Interactions**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any session information about the client.

3. **Use of Standard HTTP Methods**: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:
   - **GET**: Retrieve a resource.
   - **POST**: Create a new resource.
   - **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
   - **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

4. **Representation of Resources**: Resources can be represented in various formats, such as JSON or XML. JSON is commonly used due to its simplicity and ease of use with JavaScript.

5. **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**: Clients interact with resources through hyperlinks provided by the server, allowing them to navigate the API dynamically.

6. **Layered System**: REST allows for a layered architecture where intermediaries, such as proxies or gateways, can be used to improve scalability and security.

### Designing RESTful APIs in Clojure

Clojure's functional programming paradigm and immutable data structures make it an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs. Let's explore how to design a RESTful API using Clojure, focusing on resource identification, HTTP methods, and status codes.

#### Resource Identification

In Clojure, we can define routes using libraries like Compojure, which provides a concise syntax for mapping URLs to handler functions. Here's an example of defining a route for a book resource:

```clojure
(ns library-api.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/books/:id" [id]
    ;; Handler function to retrieve a book by ID
    (retrieve-book id))
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000}))
```

In this example, we define a route for retrieving a book by its ID using the `GET` method. The `retrieve-book` function is responsible for handling the request and returning the appropriate response.

#### Using HTTP Methods

Clojure's Compojure library allows us to define routes for different HTTP methods easily. Let's extend our example to include routes for creating, updating, and deleting books:

```clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/books/:id" [id]
    (retrieve-book id))
  (POST "/books" request
    ;; Handler function to create a new book
    (create-book request))
  (PUT "/books/:id" [id request]
    ;; Handler function to update an existing book
    (update-book id request))
  (DELETE "/books/:id" [id]
    ;; Handler function to delete a book
    (delete-book id))
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))
```

Each route corresponds to a specific HTTP method, allowing us to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the book resource.

#### Handling HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are essential for indicating the result of a client's request. In Clojure, we can use Ring, a Clojure web application library, to set status codes in our responses. Here's an example of returning different status codes based on the outcome of a request:

```clojure
(defn retrieve-book [id]
  (let [book (find-book-by-id id)]
    (if book
      {:status 200 :body book}  ; 200 OK
      {:status 404 :body "Book not found"})))  ; 404 Not Found

(defn create-book [request]
  (let [book-data (parse-request-body request)]
    (if (valid-book? book-data)
      {:status 201 :body (save-book book-data)}  ; 201 Created
      {:status 400 :body "Invalid book data"})))  ; 400 Bad Request
```

In these examples, we use status codes like `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `201 Created`, and `400 Bad Request` to communicate the result of the operation to the client.

### Documenting RESTful APIs

Effective documentation is crucial for ensuring that frontend developers and other API consumers can understand and use your API. Tools like Swagger can help automate the documentation process by generating interactive API documentation.

#### Using Swagger for API Documentation

Swagger is a popular tool for documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for exploring API endpoints and understanding their inputs and outputs. To integrate Swagger with a Clojure application, we can use the `ring-swagger` library.

Here's an example of how to set up Swagger documentation for our book API:

```clojure
(ns library-api.swagger
  (:require [ring.swagger.swagger2 :refer [swagger-json]]
            [ring.swagger.ui :refer [swagger-ui]]
            [compojure.core :refer :all]))

(def swagger-spec
  {:swagger "2.0"
   :info {:title "Library API"
          :description "API for managing books in a library"
          :version "1.0.0"}
   :paths {"/books/{id}" {:get {:summary "Retrieve a book by ID"
                                :parameters [{:name "id"
                                              :in "path"
                                              :required true
                                              :type "string"}]
                                :responses {200 {:description "Book found"}
                                            404 {:description "Book not found"}}}}
           "/books" {:post {:summary "Create a new book"
                            :parameters [{:name "book"
                                          :in "body"
                                          :required true
                                          :schema {:type "object"
                                                   :properties {:title {:type "string"}
                                                                :author {:type "string"}}}}]
                            :responses {201 {:description "Book created"}
                                        400 {:description "Invalid book data"}}}}}})

(defroutes swagger-routes
  (GET "/swagger.json" [] (swagger-json swagger-spec))
  (swagger-ui "/swagger-ui" "/swagger.json"))
```

In this example, we define a Swagger specification for our API, including details about each endpoint, its parameters, and possible responses. The `swagger-ui` function serves the Swagger UI, allowing developers to interact with the API documentation.
