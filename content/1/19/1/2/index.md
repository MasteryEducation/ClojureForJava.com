## 19.1.2 Setting Up Project Infrastructure

Setting up the project infrastructure is a crucial step in building a robust full-stack application with Clojure. This section will guide you through the process of initializing a new Clojure project, configuring essential files, and organizing your codebase for maintainability and scalability. We'll explore the use of tools like Leiningen and tools.deps, discuss directory structures, and introduce necessary dependencies and libraries.

### Initializing a New Clojure Project

#### Using Leiningen

Leiningen is a popular build automation tool for Clojure, similar to Maven in the Java ecosystem. It simplifies project setup, dependency management, and builds tasks.

1. **Install Leiningen**: If you haven't already, install Leiningen by following the [official installation guide](https://leiningen.org/#install).

2. **Create a New Project**: Use the `lein new` command to create a new project. For example, to create a project named `my-fullstack-app`, run:

   ```bash
   lein new app my-fullstack-app
   ```

   This command generates a basic project structure with a `project.clj` file, which is similar to a `pom.xml` in Maven.

3. **Configure `project.clj`**: Open the `project.clj` file and configure it with your project's details, such as name, version, and dependencies.

   ```clojure
   (defproject my-fullstack-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :description "A full-stack application using Clojure"
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                    [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]
                    [compojure "1.6.2"]]
     :main ^:skip-aot my-fullstack-app.core
     :target-path "target/%s"
     :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
   ```

   - **Dependencies**: Add libraries such as Ring and Compojure for web development.
   - **Main Namespace**: Specify the main namespace for your application.

#### Using tools.deps

tools.deps is a more recent tool for dependency management in Clojure, offering flexibility and simplicity.

1. **Install tools.deps**: Follow the [official guide](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) to install the Clojure CLI tools.

2. **Create a New Project**: Unlike Leiningen, tools.deps doesn't have a built-in project template. You can manually create a directory and a `deps.edn` file.

   ```bash
   mkdir my-fullstack-app
   cd my-fullstack-app
   touch deps.edn
   ```

3. **Configure `deps.edn`**: Open the `deps.edn` file and define your dependencies and paths.

   ```clojure
   {:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
           ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}
           compojure {:mvn/version "1.6.2"}}
    :paths ["src" "resources"]
    :aliases {:dev {:extra-paths ["dev"]
                    :extra-deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.26.0"}}}}}
   ```

   - **Dependencies**: Specify libraries and their versions.
   - **Paths**: Define source and resource directories.
   - **Aliases**: Create profiles for development, testing, etc.

### Setting Up a Monorepo or Separate Repositories

Deciding between a monorepo and separate repositories depends on your project's complexity and team structure.

#### Monorepo

A monorepo contains both backend and frontend code in a single repository, simplifying dependency management and version control.

- **Directory Structure**:

  ```
  my-fullstack-app/
  ├── backend/
  │   ├── src/
  │   ├── resources/
  │   └── project.clj
  ├── frontend/
  │   ├── src/
  │   ├── resources/
  │   └── package.json
  └── README.md
  ```

- **Advantages**: Easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent versions across the stack.
- **Challenges**: Can become unwieldy as the project grows.

#### Separate Repositories

Separate repositories for backend and frontend allow for independent development and deployment.

- **Directory Structure**:

  ```
  my-fullstack-backend/
  ├── src/
  ├── resources/
  └── project.clj

  my-fullstack-frontend/
  ├── src/
  ├── resources/
  └── package.json
  ```

- **Advantages**: Clear separation of concerns and easier to scale teams.
- **Challenges**: Requires more coordination for integration and deployment.

### Organizing Code for Maintainability

A well-organized codebase enhances maintainability and scalability. Here are some best practices:

1. **Namespace Organization**: Use meaningful namespaces to group related functionalities. For example, `my-fullstack-app.core` for the main application logic and `my-fullstack-app.routes` for routing.

2. **Directory Structure**: Follow a consistent directory structure. For example:

   ```
   src/
   ├── my_fullstack_app/
   │   ├── core.clj
   │   ├── routes.clj
   │   └── handlers.clj
   └── resources/
       └── public/
   ```

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate business logic, data access, and presentation layers.

4. **Documentation**: Include documentation for each module and function. Use tools like [Codox](https://github.com/weavejester/codox) for generating API documentation.

### Introducing Dependencies and Libraries

Choosing the right dependencies is crucial for building a robust application. Here are some commonly used libraries:

- **Ring**: A Clojure web application library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack.
- **Compojure**: A routing library for Ring, providing a concise syntax for defining routes.
- **Reagent**: A ClojureScript interface to React, used for building frontend components.
- **Re-frame**: A pattern for managing state in Reagent applications.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following tasks to deepen your understanding:

- Modify the `project.clj` or `deps.edn` to add a new dependency, such as `cheshire` for JSON processing.
- Create a new namespace for handling database interactions and add a simple function to connect to a database.
- Set up a basic frontend project using Reagent and connect it to your backend API.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of data through a Clojure full-stack application, highlighting the interaction between the backend and frontend components.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Frontend (Reagent)] -->|HTTP Request| B[Backend (Ring/Compojure)];
    B -->|Database Query| C[Database];
    C -->|Data Response| B;
    B -->|HTTP Response| A;
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Leiningen and tools.deps** are essential tools for managing Clojure projects, each with its strengths.
- **Monorepo vs. Separate Repositories**: Choose based on project complexity and team structure.
- **Code Organization**: Follow best practices for maintainability and scalability.
- **Dependencies**: Select libraries that align with your project's requirements.

### Exercises

1. **Initialize a new Clojure project** using both Leiningen and tools.deps. Compare the setup process and configuration files.
2. **Organize a sample project** with a monorepo structure, including both backend and frontend code.
3. **Add a new feature** to your project, such as a RESTful API endpoint, and document the process.

By following these guidelines, you'll be well-equipped to set up a robust project infrastructure for your Clojure full-stack application. Now, let's dive deeper into building the backend and frontend components in the subsequent sections.
