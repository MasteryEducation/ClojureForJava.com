## 6.5 Creating Custom Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of functional programming and a powerful feature in Clojure. They allow us to write more abstract, flexible, and reusable code by operating on functions themselves. In this section, we'll explore how to create custom higher-order functions in Clojure, drawing parallels with Java where applicable. We'll cover the basics, provide detailed examples, and encourage you to experiment with the concepts.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

A higher-order function is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. This concept is not unique to Clojure; Java has similar capabilities, especially since Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and functional interfaces.

#### Java vs. Clojure: A Quick Comparison

In Java, higher-order functions are typically implemented using functional interfaces like `Function`, `Predicate`, or `Consumer`. Here's a simple Java example using a `Function` interface:

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class HigherOrderFunctionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
        Function<Integer, Integer> increment = x -> x + 1;

        Function<Integer, Integer> squareThenIncrement = square.andThen(increment);

        System.out.println(squareThenIncrement.apply(5)); // Outputs 26
    }
}
```

In Clojure, functions are first-class citizens, and higher-order functions are a natural part of the language. Here's how you might achieve the same functionality in Clojure:

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(defn increment [x]
  (+ x 1))

(defn compose [f g]
  (fn [x]
    (g (f x))))

(def square-then-increment (compose square increment))

(println (square-then-increment 5)) ; Outputs 26
```

### Creating a Function Composition

Function composition is a common pattern in functional programming. It involves combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Let's create a custom higher-order function in Clojure that composes two functions.

```clojure
(defn compose [f g]
  "Returns a new function that applies f and then g."
  (fn [x]
    (g (f x))))

;; Example usage
(defn double [x] (* 2 x))
(defn add-ten [x] (+ 10 x))

(def double-then-add-ten (compose double add-ten))

(println (double-then-add-ten 5)) ; Outputs 20
```

**Explanation:**
- **`compose`**: This function takes two functions `f` and `g` as arguments and returns a new function. The returned function takes an argument `x`, applies `f` to `x`, and then applies `g` to the result of `f(x)`.

### Applying a Function Multiple Times

Another useful higher-order function is one that applies a given function multiple times. This can be particularly useful for operations like repeated transformations or iterative processes.

```clojure
(defn apply-n-times [f n]
  "Returns a function that applies f to its argument n times."
  (fn [x]
    (loop [i n
           result x]
      (if (zero? i)
        result
        (recur (dec i) (f result))))))

;; Example usage
(defn increment [x] (+ x 1))

(def increment-five-times (apply-n-times increment 5))

(println (increment-five-times 10)) ; Outputs 15
```

**Explanation:**
- **`apply-n-times`**: This function takes a function `f` and a number `n`, returning a new function that applies `f` to its argument `n` times.
- **`loop` and `recur`**: These are used for iteration in Clojure, allowing us to repeatedly apply `f` without stack overflow issues.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `compose` and `apply-n-times` functions:
- Modify the `compose` function to handle more than two functions.
- Create a higher-order function that applies a list of functions in sequence to an argument.
- Use `apply-n-times` with different functions and values of `n`.

### Visualizing Function Composition

To better understand how function composition works, let's visualize the flow of data through composed functions using a Mermaid.js diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[x] --> B[f(x)];
    B --> C[g(f(x))];
```

**Diagram Explanation:**
- **A**: Represents the initial input `x`.
- **B**: Represents the result of applying function `f` to `x`.
- **C**: Represents the final result after applying function `g` to `f(x)`.

### Advanced Examples and Exercises

Let's explore more advanced examples of custom higher-order functions and provide exercises to reinforce learning.

#### Example: Creating a Pipeline Function

A pipeline function allows you to apply a series of transformations to data, similar to Unix pipelines or Java Streams.

```clojure
(defn pipeline [& fns]
  "Returns a function that applies a series of functions to its argument."
  (fn [x]
    (reduce (fn [acc f] (f acc)) x fns)))

;; Example usage
(defn square [x] (* x x))
(defn halve [x] (/ x 2))

(def process (pipeline square halve increment))

(println (process 4)) ; Outputs 9
```

**Explanation:**
- **`pipeline`**: This function takes a variable number of functions and returns a new function. It uses `reduce` to apply each function in sequence to the initial argument.

#### Exercise: Implement a `filter-map` Function

Create a higher-order function `filter-map` that filters a collection based on a predicate and then maps a function over the filtered results.

```clojure
(defn filter-map [pred f coll]
  "Filters coll using pred and then maps f over the results."
  (map f (filter pred coll)))

;; Example usage
(defn even? [x] (zero? (mod x 2)))
(defn square [x] (* x x))

(println (filter-map even? square [1 2 3 4 5])) ; Outputs (4 16)
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Higher-order functions** are powerful tools for creating flexible and reusable code.
- Clojure's first-class functions make it easy to create and use higher-order functions.
- **Function composition** and **function application** are common patterns that can simplify complex operations.
- Experimenting with custom higher-order functions can deepen your understanding of functional programming.

### Exercises

1. Modify the `compose` function to handle a list of functions instead of just two.
2. Implement a `memoize` higher-order function that caches the results of expensive function calls.
3. Create a `retry` function that retries a given function a specified number of times if it throws an exception.

Now that we've explored how to create custom higher-order functions in Clojure, let's apply these concepts to build more powerful and expressive programs.
