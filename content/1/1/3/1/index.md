## 1.3.1 Immutable Data Structures

As experienced Java developers, you're likely accustomed to mutable data structures where changes are made in place. In contrast, Clojure's immutable data structures offer a paradigm shift that enhances code safety, simplifies concurrency, and improves maintainability. Let's delve into the world of immutability in Clojure, exploring its benefits and how it compares to Java's mutable approach.

### Understanding Immutability

In Clojure, core data structures—**lists**, **vectors**, **maps**, and **sets**—are immutable by default. This means that once a data structure is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying data in place, operations on these structures produce new versions with the desired changes. This immutability leads to safer code with fewer side effects, simplifying reasoning about program behavior and enhancing concurrency safety.

#### Why Immutability?

Immutability offers several advantages:

- **Predictability**: Since data structures cannot change, functions that operate on them are easier to reason about.
- **Concurrency**: Immutable data structures eliminate the need for locks, reducing the complexity of concurrent programming.
- **Safety**: With no side effects, functions are less likely to introduce bugs related to unintended data modifications.

### Immutable Data Structures in Clojure

Let's explore Clojure's immutable data structures and how they compare to Java's mutable counterparts.

#### Lists

Clojure lists are linked lists, optimized for sequential access. They are similar to Java's `LinkedList`, but immutable.

```clojure
(def my-list '(1 2 3)) ; Define an immutable list
(def new-list (cons 0 my-list)) ; Add an element to the front
```

In Java, you might use a `LinkedList` and modify it directly:

```java
List<Integer> myList = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
myList.add(0, 0); // Modifies the list in place
```

#### Vectors

Vectors in Clojure are similar to Java's `ArrayList`, providing efficient random access and updates.

```clojure
(def my-vector [1 2 3]) ; Define an immutable vector
(def new-vector (conj my-vector 4)) ; Add an element to the end
```

In Java, an `ArrayList` is mutable:

```java
List<Integer> myVector = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
myVector.add(4); // Modifies the list in place
```

#### Maps

Clojure maps are akin to Java's `HashMap`, but immutable.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2}) ; Define an immutable map
(def new-map (assoc my-map :c 3)) ; Add a key-value pair
```

In Java, a `HashMap` is mutable:

```java
Map<String, Integer> myMap = new HashMap<>();
myMap.put("a", 1);
myMap.put("b", 2);
myMap.put("c", 3); // Modifies the map in place
```

#### Sets

Clojure sets are similar to Java's `HashSet`, providing unique elements.

```clojure
(def my-set #{1 2 3}) ; Define an immutable set
(def new-set (conj my-set 4)) ; Add an element
```

In Java, a `HashSet` is mutable:

```java
Set<Integer> mySet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
mySet.add(4); // Modifies the set in place
```

### Structural Sharing and Performance

One might wonder how Clojure achieves efficiency with immutable data structures. The answer lies in **structural sharing**. When a new version of a data structure is created, it shares as much of the existing structure as possible, minimizing memory usage and improving performance.

#### Example of Structural Sharing

Consider adding an element to a vector:

```clojure
(def original-vector [1 2 3])
(def new-vector (conj original-vector 4)) ; [1 2 3 4]
```

Here, `new-vector` shares the first three elements with `original-vector`, only adding the new element to the end.

### Visualizing Immutability

To better understand how immutability and structural sharing work, let's visualize the process using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A["Original Vector: [1, 2, 3]"] --> B["New Vector: [1, 2, 3, 4]"];
    B --> C["Shared Elements: [1, 2, 3]"];
    B --> D[New Element: 4];
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The diagram illustrates how the new vector shares elements with the original vector, only adding the new element separately.

### Immutability in Practice

Let's explore a practical example to see how immutability can simplify code.

#### Example: Managing a Shopping Cart

Imagine a shopping cart application where items can be added or removed. In Java, you might use a mutable list to manage the cart:

```java
List<String> cart = new ArrayList<>();
cart.add("Apple");
cart.add("Banana");
cart.remove("Apple");
```

In Clojure, you can achieve the same functionality with immutable data structures. Below are two approaches depending on your needs:

1) Using a Vector (order preserved, duplicates allowed):
```clojure
;; Start with an empty vector
(def cart [])

;; conj appends items to the vector
(def updated-cart (conj cart "Apple" "Banana"))
;; => ["Apple" "Banana"]

;; To remove an item by value, use 'remove' and re-wrap into a vector
(def final-cart (vec (remove #(= % "Apple") updated-cart)))
;; => ["Banana"]
```

2) Using a Set (unique items, no ordering):
```clojure
;; Start with an empty set
(def cart #{})

;; conj adds items to the set
(def updated-cart (conj cart "Apple" "Banana"))
;; => #{"Apple" "Banana"}

;; disj removes items from a set
(def final-cart (disj updated-cart "Apple"))
;; => #{"Banana"}
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the vector-based approach, remove returns a lazy sequence, so wrapping it with vec is a convenient way to keep the result as a vector. If you prefer unique items and are okay without a strict order, a set plus conj/disj is the simplest.


**Try It Yourself**: Modify the Clojure example to add more items to the cart and observe how the original `cart` remains unchanged.

### Comparing Immutability in Java and Clojure

While Java has introduced immutable collections in recent versions, Clojure's immutability is more deeply integrated into the language's design. This integration encourages a functional programming style, leading to more predictable and maintainable code.

#### Java's Immutable Collections

Java's `Collections.unmodifiableList` provides a way to create immutable views of collections:

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
List<String> immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(list);
```

However, this approach only prevents modifications through the immutable view. The underlying list remains mutable.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Exercise**: Create a Clojure map representing a student's grades. Add a new subject and grade, and verify that the original map remains unchanged.
2. **Challenge**: Implement a function that takes a vector of numbers and returns a new vector with each number incremented by one, without modifying the original vector.

### Key Takeaways

- Clojure's immutable data structures provide a safer, more predictable programming model.
- Immutability simplifies concurrency by eliminating the need for locks.
- Structural sharing ensures that immutable operations are efficient.
- While Java offers immutable collections, Clojure's immutability is more deeply integrated, promoting a functional programming style.
