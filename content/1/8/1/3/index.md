## 8.1.3 Traditional Concurrency Mechanisms in Java

Concurrency is a fundamental aspect of modern software development, allowing programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Java, being a language designed with concurrency in mind, provides several mechanisms to manage concurrent execution. In this section, we will explore these traditional concurrency mechanisms, including threads, locks, synchronized blocks, and concurrent collections. We will also discuss the complexities and challenges associated with these tools, such as the need for explicit synchronization and the potential for deadlocks. This understanding will set the stage for introducing Clojure's approach to managing concurrency more effectively.

### Understanding Java Threads

Java threads are the basic unit of concurrency in Java. A thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads within the same application. Java provides the `Thread` class and the `Runnable` interface to create and manage threads.

#### Creating Threads in Java

There are two primary ways to create a thread in Java:

1. **Extending the `Thread` Class**:
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyThread thread = new MyThread();
           thread.start(); // Starts the thread
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**:
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Runnable is running.");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
           thread.start(); // Starts the thread
       }
   }
   ```

In both examples, the `run` method contains the code that will be executed by the thread. The `start` method is used to begin the execution of the thread.

### Synchronization and Locks

When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization is necessary to prevent data inconsistency. Java provides several mechanisms for synchronization:

#### Synchronized Blocks and Methods

The `synchronized` keyword in Java is used to lock an object for mutual exclusion. It can be applied to methods or blocks of code.

- **Synchronized Method**:
  ```java
  public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
      // Critical section
  }
  ```

- **Synchronized Block**:
  ```java
  public void method() {
      synchronized(this) {
          // Critical section
      }
  }
  ```

The `synchronized` keyword ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section at a time, preventing race conditions.

#### Locks

Java's `java.util.concurrent.locks` package provides more flexible locking mechanisms than the `synchronized` keyword. The `Lock` interface and its implementations, such as `ReentrantLock`, offer advanced features like try-locking and timed locking.

- **Using `ReentrantLock`**:
  ```java
  import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
  import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

  public class Main {
      private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

      public void performTask() {
          lock.lock();
          try {
              // Critical section
          } finally {
              lock.unlock();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

The `ReentrantLock` provides explicit lock and unlock methods, giving developers more control over the locking process.

### Concurrent Collections

Java's `java.util.concurrent` package includes thread-safe collections that simplify concurrent programming by handling synchronization internally.

#### Common Concurrent Collections

- **ConcurrentHashMap**: A thread-safe variant of `HashMap` that allows concurrent read and write operations.
- **CopyOnWriteArrayList**: A thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` where all mutative operations are implemented by making a fresh copy of the underlying array.
- **BlockingQueue**: A queue that supports operations that wait for the queue to become non-empty when retrieving an element and wait for space to become available in the queue when storing an element.

Example of using `ConcurrentHashMap`:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class Main {
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public void updateMap(String key, Integer value) {
        map.put(key, value);
    }

    public Integer getValue(String key) {
        return map.get(key);
    }
}
```

### Challenges with Traditional Java Concurrency

While Java provides powerful tools for concurrency, they come with significant challenges:

#### Explicit Synchronization

Developers must explicitly manage synchronization, which can lead to complex and error-prone code. Forgetting to synchronize access to shared resources can result in race conditions, while over-synchronization can lead to performance bottlenecks.

#### Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a lock. This is a common issue in Java concurrency, especially when using multiple locks.

Example of a potential deadlock:
```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Critical section
            }
        }
    }

    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock2) {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                // Critical section
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, if `method1` and `method2` are called by different threads, a deadlock can occur.

#### Complexity and Maintenance

Managing concurrency with traditional Java mechanisms can lead to complex code that is difficult to maintain and debug. The need for explicit synchronization and the potential for deadlocks add to the complexity.

### Transitioning to Clojure's Concurrency Model

Clojure offers a different approach to concurrency that simplifies many of the challenges associated with Java's traditional mechanisms. By emphasizing immutability and providing higher-level concurrency primitives, Clojure reduces the need for explicit synchronization and minimizes the risk of deadlocks.

In the next sections, we will explore how Clojure's concurrency model, including atoms, refs, agents, and software transactional memory (STM), provides a more effective and intuitive way to manage concurrent execution.

### Try It Yourself

To better understand Java's traditional concurrency mechanisms, try modifying the examples provided:

- Experiment with creating multiple threads and observe how they interact with shared resources.
- Introduce intentional race conditions by removing synchronization and observe the effects.
- Implement a simple deadlock scenario and then resolve it by reordering lock acquisition.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

- Java provides several traditional concurrency mechanisms, including threads, locks, synchronized blocks, and concurrent collections.
- While powerful, these tools require explicit synchronization and can lead to complex and error-prone code.
- Deadlocks are a common issue in Java concurrency, often resulting from improper lock management.
- Clojure offers a more effective concurrency model that emphasizes immutability and higher-level concurrency primitives.

By understanding the limitations of Java's traditional concurrency mechanisms, we can appreciate the advantages of Clojure's approach and apply these concepts to manage state effectively in our applications.
