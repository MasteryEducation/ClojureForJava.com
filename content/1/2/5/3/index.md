## 2.5.3 Understanding tools.deps and the Clojure CLI

As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies and building projects. In Clojure, while Leiningen is a popular choice, the `tools.deps` library and the Clojure CLI offer a more lightweight and flexible approach to dependency management and project execution. This section will guide you through understanding and utilizing `tools.deps` and the Clojure CLI effectively.

### Introduction to tools.deps and the Clojure CLI

`tools.deps` is a Clojure library that provides a declarative way to manage dependencies using a file called `deps.edn`. The Clojure CLI (`clj` and `clojure` commands) leverages `tools.deps` to run Clojure code, start REPL sessions, and manage project dependencies. This approach is particularly beneficial for Java developers transitioning to Clojure, as it aligns with the simplicity and flexibility of Clojure's design philosophy.

#### Key Concepts

- **deps.edn**: A configuration file where you declare your project's dependencies, paths, and aliases.
- **clj and clojure commands**: Command-line tools for running Clojure code and managing dependencies.

### Managing Dependencies with deps.edn

The `deps.edn` file is the cornerstone of dependency management in `tools.deps`. It allows you to specify libraries and their versions, similar to `pom.xml` in Maven or `build.gradle` in Gradle, but with a more concise and readable syntax.

#### Structure of deps.edn

A typical `deps.edn` file consists of several key sections:

- **:deps**: Specifies the dependencies your project requires.
- **:paths**: Lists directories containing source code and resources.
- **:aliases**: Defines custom command-line options for different tasks.

Here's an example of a simple `deps.edn` file:

```clojure
{
  :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
         org.clojure/core.async {:mvn/version "1.3.610"}}
  :paths ["src" "resources"]
  :aliases {:dev {:extra-paths ["dev"]
                  :extra-deps {org.clojure/tools.namespace {:mvn/version "1.1.0"}}}}
}
```

- **:deps**: Lists dependencies with their Maven coordinates.
- **:paths**: Specifies directories for source code and resources.
- **:aliases**: Allows for environment-specific configurations, such as adding extra dependencies or paths for development.

#### Adding Dependencies

To add a dependency, simply include it in the `:deps` map with its Maven coordinates. For example, to add the `ring` library:

```clojure
:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
       ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}}
```

#### Using Aliases

Aliases in `deps.edn` provide a powerful way to customize your development environment. They can add extra dependencies, paths, or even modify JVM options. For instance, you might define an alias for running tests:

```clojure
:aliases {:test {:extra-paths ["test"]
                 :extra-deps {lambdaisland/kaocha {:mvn/version "1.0.732"}}
                 :main-opts ["-m" "kaocha.runner"]}}
```

### Running Code and Starting REPL Sessions with clj

The `clj` command is a versatile tool for running Clojure code and managing REPL sessions. It integrates seamlessly with `tools.deps`, allowing you to execute code with the dependencies specified in `deps.edn`.

#### Starting a REPL

To start a REPL session, simply run:

```bash
clj
```

This command will launch a REPL with the dependencies and paths specified in your `deps.edn` file. You can also use aliases to customize the REPL environment:

```bash
clj -A:dev
```

This command starts a REPL with the additional paths and dependencies specified under the `:dev` alias.

#### Running Clojure Code

You can execute a Clojure script using the `-m` option followed by the namespace containing the `-main` function:

```bash
clj -m my.namespace
```

This is analogous to running a Java application with a `main` method.

#### Using the clojure Command

The `clojure` command is similar to `clj` but is optimized for scripting and automation. It does not start a REPL by default and is often used in scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

### Comparing tools.deps with Java's Dependency Management

While Maven and Gradle are powerful tools for Java projects, `tools.deps` offers a more lightweight and flexible approach, aligning with Clojure's philosophy of simplicity and composability.

#### Key Differences

- **Declarative vs. Imperative**: `deps.edn` is purely declarative, focusing on what dependencies are needed rather than how to build the project.
- **Flexibility**: `tools.deps` allows for more dynamic and flexible dependency management, with aliases providing a way to customize environments without modifying the core configuration.
- **Simplicity**: The `deps.edn` format is simpler and more concise than XML or Groovy scripts.

#### Similarities

- **Centralized Dependency Management**: Like Maven's `pom.xml` or Gradle's `build.gradle`, `deps.edn` centralizes dependency declarations.
- **Integration with Maven Central**: `tools.deps` can pull dependencies from Maven Central, similar to Java's build tools.

### Practical Examples and Exercises

Let's explore some practical examples to solidify your understanding of `tools.deps` and the Clojure CLI.

#### Example 1: Adding a New Dependency

Suppose you want to add the `cheshire` library for JSON parsing. Update your `deps.edn` as follows:

```clojure
:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
       cheshire/cheshire {:mvn/version "5.10.0"}}
```

Try running a simple script that uses `cheshire` to parse JSON:

```clojure
(ns my.json
  (:require [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn parse-json [json-str]
  (json/parse-string json-str true))

;; Test the function
(println (parse-json "{\"name\":\"Clojure\",\"type\":\"language\"}"))
```

Run this script using:

```bash
clj -m my.json
```

#### Example 2: Using Aliases for Development

Create a `:dev` alias to include development tools like `cider-nrepl` for enhanced REPL capabilities:

```clojure
:aliases {:dev {:extra-deps {nrepl/nrepl {:mvn/version "0.8.3"}
                             cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.25.9"}}
                :main-opts ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline" "--middleware" "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]"]}}
```

Start a REPL with:

```bash
clj -A:dev
```

This command sets up a REPL with additional middleware for a richer development experience.

### Try It Yourself

- **Modify the deps.edn**: Add a new library and write a script to utilize it.
- **Experiment with Aliases**: Create an alias for running tests or starting a specific REPL configuration.
- **Compare with Java**: Reflect on how `tools.deps` simplifies or complicates tasks compared to Maven or Gradle.
