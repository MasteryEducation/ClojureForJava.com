## 2.1.3 Setting Up Environment Variables

Setting up environment variables is a crucial step in configuring your development environment for Java and Clojure. This guide will walk you through the process of setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and updating the system's `PATH` variable across different operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux. These steps ensure that your system can locate the Java Development Kit (JDK) and execute Java applications seamlessly.

### Why Environment Variables Matter

Environment variables are key-value pairs that can influence the behavior of running processes on your computer. For Java developers, setting the `JAVA_HOME` variable is essential because it tells your system where the JDK is installed. This is particularly important when compiling Java code or running Java-based applications like Clojure.

### Setting Up Environment Variables on Windows

On Windows, environment variables can be set through the Control Panel or the Settings app. Here’s how you can set up `JAVA_HOME` and update the `PATH` variable:

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open System Properties**:
   - Press `Win + X` and select **System**.
   - Click on **Advanced system settings** on the left panel.
   - In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.

2. **Set JAVA_HOME**:
   - In the **Environment Variables** window, click **New** under the **System variables** section.
   - Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the **Variable name**.
   - Enter the path to your JDK installation as the **Variable value** (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`).

3. **Update PATH Variable**:
   - In the **System variables** section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the list.

4. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click **OK** to close all dialog boxes.

5. **Verify Setup**:
   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type `echo %JAVA_HOME%` to verify the `JAVA_HOME` path.
   - Type `java -version` to ensure Java is accessible from the command line.

### Setting Up Environment Variables on macOS

On macOS, environment variables are typically set in shell configuration files such as `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`, depending on the shell you are using.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Launch the Terminal application from the Utilities folder or by searching in Spotlight.

2. **Edit Shell Configuration File**:
   - For Bash users, open `.bash_profile`:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bash_profile
     ```
   - For Zsh users, open `.zshrc`:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```

3. **Set JAVA_HOME**:
   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
     ```

4. **Update PATH Variable**:
   - Add the following line to include the Java binaries:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
     ```

5. **Apply Changes**:
   - Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
   - Run the following command to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```
   - Or for Zsh:
     ```bash
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

6. **Verify Setup**:
   - In Terminal, type `echo $JAVA_HOME` to verify the `JAVA_HOME` path.
   - Type `java -version` to ensure Java is accessible.

### Setting Up Environment Variables on Linux

On Linux, environment variables can be set in files like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `/etc/profile`, depending on your distribution and shell.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Use your preferred method to open a terminal window.

2. **Edit Shell Configuration File**:
   - Open `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for editing:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Or for global settings, edit `/etc/profile` (requires sudo):
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/profile
     ```

3. **Set JAVA_HOME**:
   - Add the following line to the file:
     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
     ```

4. **Update PATH Variable**:
   - Add the following line to include the Java binaries:
     ```bash
     export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
     ```

5. **Apply Changes**:
   - Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
   - Run the following command to apply the changes:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

6. **Verify Setup**:
   - In Terminal, type `echo $JAVA_HOME` to verify the `JAVA_HOME` path.
   - Type `java -version` to ensure Java is accessible.

### Importance of Restarting the Terminal or System

After setting environment variables, it's crucial to restart your terminal or even your system to ensure that the changes take effect. This is because environment variables are loaded when a terminal session starts, and changes won't be recognized in already open sessions.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding, try modifying the environment variable setup:

- **Change the Java version**: If you have multiple JDKs installed, switch the `JAVA_HOME` path to point to a different version and verify the change.
- **Add a custom script directory**: Update your `PATH` variable to include a directory where you store custom scripts, and test if you can execute a script from any location.

### Key Takeaways

- **Environment variables** are essential for configuring your development environment.
- **JAVA_HOME** and **PATH** are critical variables for Java and Clojure development.
- **Platform-specific instructions** ensure you can set up your environment on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Restarting your terminal or system** is necessary for changes to take effect.
