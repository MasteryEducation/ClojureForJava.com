## 13.2.2 Using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

In the realm of functional programming, Clojure stands out with its elegant and expressive tools for data transformation. Among these tools, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are foundational functions that enable developers to process collections efficiently and declaratively. This section delves into these powerful functions, illustrating their use through practical examples and highlighting their significance in functional programming.

### Understanding the Power of Functional Programming

Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and declarative code. This paradigm contrasts with imperative programming, where the focus is on how to achieve a result through explicit instructions. In functional programming, you describe what you want to achieve, and the language handles the rest.

Clojure, as a functional language, provides first-class support for functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which allow you to express complex data transformations succinctly and clearly. These functions are not just tools; they represent a mindset shift towards thinking about data processing in terms of transformations rather than iterations.

### The `map` Function: Transforming Data

The `map` function is used to apply a given function to each element of a collection, producing a new collection of results. This is akin to transforming each item in a list based on a specific rule or operation.

#### Basic Usage of `map`

Consider a simple example where we want to square each number in a list:

```clojure
(def numbers [1 2 3 4 5])

(defn square [n]
  (* n n))

(def squared-numbers (map square numbers))
; => (1 4 9 16 25)
```

In this example, `map` takes the `square` function and applies it to each element of the `numbers` list, resulting in a new list of squared values.

#### Mapping with Anonymous Functions

Clojure allows the use of anonymous functions, which can be particularly useful for short, one-off transformations:

```clojure
(def squared-numbers (map #(Math/pow % 2) numbers))
; => (1.0 4.0 9.0 16.0 25.0)
```

Here, we use the shorthand `#()` syntax to define an anonymous function that squares each number.

#### Mapping Over Multiple Collections

`map` can also operate over multiple collections, applying a function that takes multiple arguments:

```clojure
(def numbers1 [1 2 3])
(def numbers2 [4 5 6])

(defn add [a b]
  (+ a b))

(def summed-numbers (map add numbers1 numbers2))
; => (5 7 9)
```

In this case, `map` applies the `add` function to corresponding elements of `numbers1` and `numbers2`.

### The `filter` Function: Selecting Data

The `filter` function is used to select elements from a collection that satisfy a given predicate function. This is useful for narrowing down data based on specific criteria.

#### Basic Usage of `filter`

Suppose we want to filter out even numbers from a list:

```clojure
(defn even? [n]
  (zero? (mod n 2)))

(def even-numbers (filter even? numbers))
; => (2 4)
```

Here, `filter` applies the `even?` predicate to each element of `numbers`, returning only those that are even.

#### Filtering with Anonymous Functions

As with `map`, you can use anonymous functions with `filter`:

```clojure
(def odd-numbers (filter #(odd? %) numbers))
; => (1 3 5)
```

This example filters out odd numbers using an anonymous function.

### The `reduce` Function: Aggregating Data

The `reduce` function is used to aggregate or combine elements of a collection into a single result. It applies a binary function cumulatively to the elements of a collection.

#### Basic Usage of `reduce`

Consider summing a list of numbers:

```clojure
(defn sum [a b]
  (+ a b))

(def total (reduce sum numbers))
; => 15
```

`reduce` applies the `sum` function to the elements of `numbers`, accumulating the result.

#### Using `reduce` with an Initial Value

You can also provide an initial value to `reduce`, which is useful for operations like finding the maximum value:

```clojure
(def max-value (reduce max numbers))
; => 5
```

Here, `reduce` uses the `max` function to find the largest number in the list.

### Combining `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`

The true power of these functions emerges when they are combined to perform complex data transformations. Consider a scenario where we have a list of numbers, and we want to find the sum of the squares of the even numbers:

```clojure
(def numbers [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])

(def result
  (->> numbers
       (filter even?)
       (map #(* % %))
       (reduce +)))
; => 220
```

In this example, we use the threading macro `->>` to pass the result of each function to the next, creating a pipeline that filters, maps, and reduces the data.

### Practical Code Examples

Let's explore a practical example involving a dataset of people, where we want to extract and process specific information.

#### Example: Processing a Dataset

Suppose we have a dataset of people, each represented as a map with keys `:name`, `:age`, and `:city`. We want to find the average age of people living in "New York".

```clojure
(def people
  [{:name "Alice" :age 30 :city "New York"}
   {:name "Bob" :age 25 :city "Los Angeles"}
   {:name "Charlie" :age 35 :city "New York"}
   {:name "David" :age 40 :city "Chicago"}
   {:name "Eve" :age 28 :city "New York"}])

(defn average [nums]
  (/ (reduce + nums) (count nums)))

(def average-age-ny
  (->> people
       (filter #(= (:city %) "New York"))
       (map :age)
       (average)))
; => 31
```

In this example, we filter the dataset for people living in "New York", map their ages, and then calculate the average age using a custom `average` function.

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- **Use Pure Functions:** Ensure that the functions you pass to `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are pure, meaning they have no side effects and return the same result for the same inputs.
- **Leverage Laziness:** Clojure's sequences are lazy by default, meaning they compute elements only as needed. This can improve performance, especially with large datasets.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Intermediate Collections:** When chaining transformations, use the threading macros `->` or `->>` to avoid creating unnecessary intermediate collections.
- **Consider Performance:** While `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are powerful, they may not always be the most performant choice for every scenario. Consider alternatives like transducers for more complex transformations.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Mutability:** Avoid using mutable data structures within `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Clojure's immutable data structures are designed to work seamlessly with these functions.
- **Complex Logic in Anonymous Functions:** Keep anonymous functions simple and focused. For complex logic, consider defining a named function for clarity and reusability.
- **Misunderstanding `reduce` Initial Value:** Be mindful of the initial value in `reduce`, as it can affect the outcome of the aggregation.

### Conclusion

The functions `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are cornerstones of functional programming in Clojure. They provide a powerful and expressive way to transform and aggregate data, enabling developers to write concise and declarative code. By mastering these functions, you can unlock the full potential of Clojure's functional programming paradigm, leading to more robust and maintainable code.
