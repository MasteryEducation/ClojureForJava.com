## 13.2.2 Routing with Compojure

In this section, we delve into **Compojure**, a powerful routing library for Clojure, built on top of the Ring library. Compojure provides a concise and expressive syntax for defining routes and building RESTful endpoints, making it an excellent choice for web development in Clojure. As experienced Java developers, you'll find Compojure's approach to routing both familiar and refreshingly different from Java's traditional servlet-based frameworks.

### Introduction to Compojure

Compojure is a routing library that simplifies the process of defining routes and handling HTTP requests in Clojure web applications. It is built on top of Ring, a Clojure web application library that provides a simple and flexible way to handle HTTP requests and responses.

#### Why Use Compojure?

- **Concise Syntax**: Compojure's syntax is minimalistic and expressive, allowing you to define routes with ease.
- **Integration with Ring**: Compojure seamlessly integrates with Ring, enabling you to leverage Ring's middleware and request handling capabilities.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Compojure makes it straightforward to build RESTful APIs, a common requirement in modern web applications.

### Setting Up Compojure

Before we dive into routing with Compojure, let's set up a basic Clojure web application with Compojure and Ring.

1. **Create a New Clojure Project**: Use Leiningen to create a new Clojure project.

   ```bash
   lein new compojure-example
   ```

2. **Add Dependencies**: Update your `project.clj` file to include Compojure and Ring.

   ```clojure
   (defproject compojure-example "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                    [compojure "1.6.2"]
                    [ring/ring-defaults "0.3.2"]])
   ```

3. **Create a Basic Server**: Set up a basic Ring server in `src/compojure_example/core.clj`.

   ```clojure
   (ns compojure-example.core
     (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
               [compojure.route :as route]
               [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
               [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))

   (defroutes app-routes
     (GET "/" [] "Hello, World!")
     (route/not-found "Not Found"))

   (def app
     (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))

   (defn -main []
     (run-jetty app {:port 3000 :join? false}))
   ```

4. **Run the Server**: Start your server using Leiningen.

   ```bash
   lein run
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and you should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

### Defining Routes with Compojure

Compojure allows you to define routes using a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that is both powerful and easy to read. Let's explore how to define routes and handle parameters.

#### Basic Route Definitions

Routes in Compojure are defined using the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and other HTTP method macros. Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Welcome to Compojure!")
  (GET "/hello/:name" [name] (str "Hello, " name "!"))
  (POST "/submit" {params :params} (str "Submitted: " params)))
```

- **GET "/"**: A simple route that returns a welcome message.
- **GET "/hello/:name"**: A route with a path parameter `:name`. The parameter is extracted and used in the response.
- **POST "/submit"**: A route that handles POST requests and accesses form parameters.

#### Handling Parameters

Compojure makes it easy to handle both path and query parameters. Let's look at an example:

```clojure
(GET "/search" [query] (str "Searching for: " query))
```

In this route, `query` is a query parameter that can be accessed directly in the route handler.

#### Using Route Destructuring

Compojure supports destructuring, allowing you to extract parameters from the request map. Here's an example:

```clojure
(POST "/login" {params :params} 
  (let [{:keys [username password]} params]
    (if (and (= username "admin") (= password "secret"))
      "Login successful!"
      "Invalid credentials.")))
```

In this example, we destructure the `params` map to extract `username` and `password`.

### Integrating with Ring Middleware

Middleware in Ring is a way to wrap handlers with additional functionality, such as logging, authentication, or session management. Compojure routes can be easily integrated with Ring middleware.

#### Applying Middleware

To apply middleware to your Compojure routes, use the `wrap-defaults` function from `ring.middleware.defaults`. Here's how you can add session and security middleware:

```clojure
(def app
  (-> app-routes
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))
```

The `site-defaults` middleware includes common middleware for web applications, such as session handling and security headers.

#### Custom Middleware

You can also create custom middleware to add specific functionality to your application. Here's an example of a simple logging middleware:

```clojure
(defn wrap-logging [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (println "Request received:" request)
    (handler request)))

(def app
  (-> app-routes
      (wrap-logging)
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))
```

### Building RESTful Endpoints

Compojure is well-suited for building RESTful APIs. Let's create a simple API for managing a list of items.

#### Defining RESTful Routes

Here's an example of a basic RESTful API with Compojure:

```clojure
(def items (atom []))

(defroutes api-routes
  (GET "/items" [] @items)
  (POST "/items" {params :params}
    (let [item (get params "item")]
      (swap! items conj item)
      (str "Added item: " item)))
  (DELETE "/items/:id" [id]
    (let [id (Integer. id)]
      (swap! items #(vec (remove #(= id (first %)) %)))
      (str "Deleted item with id: " id))))
```

- **GET "/items"**: Returns the list of items.
- **POST "/items"**: Adds a new item to the list.
- **DELETE "/items/:id"**: Deletes an item by its ID.

#### Handling JSON Data

In modern web applications, JSON is a common data format for APIs. Let's modify our API to handle JSON data using the `ring-json` middleware.

1. **Add the Dependency**: Update your `project.clj` to include `ring-json`.

   ```clojure
   [ring/ring-json "0.5.0"]
   ```

2. **Apply JSON Middleware**: Use `wrap-json-body` and `wrap-json-response` to handle JSON requests and responses.

   ```clojure
   (ns compojure-example.core
     (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
               [compojure.route :as route]
               [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
               [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]
               [ring.middleware.json :refer [wrap-json-body wrap-json-response]]))

   (def app
     (-> app-routes
         (wrap-json-body)
         (wrap-json-response)
         (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))
   ```

3. **Update the API**: Modify the API to work with JSON data.

   ```clojure
   (POST "/items" {body :body}
     (let [item (:item body)]
       (swap! items conj item)
       {:status 201 :body {:message "Item added" :item item}}))
   ```

### Comparing Compojure with Java Servlets

For Java developers, the transition to Compojure from traditional servlet-based frameworks can be enlightening. Let's compare a simple route in Compojure with a Java servlet.

#### Compojure Example

```clojure
(GET "/hello/:name" [name] (str "Hello, " name "!"))
```

#### Java Servlet Example

```java
@WebServlet("/hello/*")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        String name = request.getPathInfo().substring(1);
        response.getWriter().write("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
}
```

**Comparison**:
- **Conciseness**: Compojure's syntax is more concise and expressive.
- **Parameter Handling**: Compojure automatically extracts path parameters, whereas Java servlets require manual extraction.
- **Functional Approach**: Compojure embraces a functional programming style, making it easier to reason about and test.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of routing with Compojure, try modifying the code examples to deepen your understanding:

- **Add a PUT route**: Implement a route to update an existing item.
- **Enhance Error Handling**: Add error handling for invalid requests.
- **Integrate with a Database**: Replace the in-memory atom with a database-backed storage solution.

### Exercises

1. **Create a Simple Blog API**: Define routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
2. **Implement Authentication**: Add middleware to handle user authentication and authorization.
3. **Build a JSON API**: Create a JSON-based API for managing a collection of books.
