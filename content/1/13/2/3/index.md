## 13.2.3 Other Web Frameworks

In the Clojure ecosystem, several web frameworks offer unique features and capabilities that cater to different development needs. In this section, we will explore three prominent frameworks: **Luminus**, **Pedestal**, and **Liberator**. Each framework provides distinct advantages and is suited for specific types of web applications. By understanding their core features and differences, you can make informed decisions about which framework best aligns with your project requirements.

### Luminus: A Full-Featured Web Framework

**Luminus** is a comprehensive web framework that provides a cohesive stack for building web applications. It is designed to be approachable for developers familiar with traditional web frameworks like Spring in Java, offering a similar level of structure and convenience.

#### Key Features of Luminus

- **Integrated Stack**: Luminus integrates several libraries and tools to provide a full-featured development environment. This includes support for database access, templating, routing, and more.
- **Convention Over Configuration**: Luminus emphasizes sensible defaults and conventions, reducing the need for extensive configuration.
- **Modular Design**: The framework is modular, allowing developers to include only the components they need.
- **Rich Documentation**: Luminus offers extensive documentation and community support, making it easier for developers to get started.

#### Luminus Code Example

Let's look at a simple "Hello, World!" application using Luminus:

```clojure
(ns my-luminus-app.core
  (:require [luminus.http-server :as http]
            [luminus.middleware :refer [wrap-base]]
            [ring.util.response :refer [response]]))

(defn handler [request]
  ;; Define a simple handler that returns "Hello, World!"
  (response "Hello, World!"))

(defn -main [& args]
  ;; Start the Luminus server with the handler
  (http/start {:handler (wrap-base handler)}))
```

**Try It Yourself**: Modify the handler to return a JSON response instead of plain text. Use Clojure's `json/write-str` to convert a map to a JSON string.

### Pedestal: High-Performance APIs and Web Services

**Pedestal** is a set of libraries designed for building high-performance APIs and web services. It emphasizes asynchronous processing and is well-suited for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

#### Key Features of Pedestal

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Pedestal is built with asynchronous processing in mind, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- **Interceptors**: The framework uses interceptors, a powerful mechanism for handling request and response processing.
- **Flexibility**: Pedestal is highly flexible, allowing developers to build both simple and complex applications.
- **Focus on Performance**: The framework is optimized for performance, making it suitable for high-load environments.

#### Pedestal Code Example

Here's a basic example of a Pedestal service:

```clojure
(ns my-pedestal-app.core
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]))

(defn hello-world [request]
  ;; Define a simple interceptor that returns "Hello, World!"
  {:status 200 :body "Hello, World!"})

(def routes
  ;; Define routes using Pedestal's routing DSL
  (route/expand-routes
    #{["/hello" :get hello-world]}))

(def service
  ;; Define the Pedestal service with routes and interceptors
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})

(defn -main [& args]
  ;; Start the Pedestal server
  (http/start service))
```

**Try It Yourself**: Add a new route that accepts a POST request and returns a JSON response. Use Pedestal's interceptor mechanism to handle the request.

### Liberator: Resource-Oriented RESTful Services

**Liberator** is a library for building RESTful services with a focus on resource-oriented design. It simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by handling common HTTP concerns such as content negotiation and status code management.

#### Key Features of Liberator

- **Resource-Oriented Design**: Liberator encourages a resource-oriented approach, aligning with REST principles.
- **Automatic HTTP Handling**: The library automatically manages HTTP status codes, content negotiation, and other HTTP concerns.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Liberator uses a declarative syntax for defining resources, making it easy to read and maintain.
- **Extensibility**: The library is highly extensible, allowing developers to customize behavior as needed.

#### Liberator Code Example

Here's an example of a simple RESTful service using Liberator:

```clojure
(ns my-liberator-app.core
  (:require [liberator.core :refer [resource defresource]]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defresource hello-world
  ;; Define a Liberator resource that returns "Hello, World!"
  :available-media-types ["text/plain"]
  :handle-ok "Hello, World!")

(defn -main [& args]
  ;; Start the Jetty server with the Liberator resource
  (run-jetty (hello-world) {:port 8080}))
```

**Try It Yourself**: Extend the resource to support JSON responses and add a new resource that handles POST requests.

### Comparing Luminus, Pedestal, and Liberator

Each of these frameworks offers unique strengths and is suited for different types of applications:

- **Luminus** is ideal for developers looking for a full-featured framework with a coherent stack. It is similar to traditional Java frameworks like Spring, making it a comfortable choice for Java developers transitioning to Clojure.
- **Pedestal** is best suited for high-performance applications that require asynchronous processing. Its interceptor model provides flexibility and power for complex request handling.
- **Liberator** is perfect for building RESTful services with a resource-oriented approach. Its automatic handling of HTTP concerns simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.

### Choosing the Right Framework

When deciding which framework to use, consider the following factors:

- **Project Requirements**: Assess the specific needs of your project, such as performance, scalability, and ease of use.
- **Team Expertise**: Consider the familiarity of your team with Clojure and the specific frameworks.
- **Community and Support**: Evaluate the community support and documentation available for each framework.

### Conclusion

Exploring the diverse web frameworks in the Clojure ecosystem can help you find the right tools for your web development projects. Whether you need a full-featured framework like Luminus, a high-performance solution like Pedestal, or a resource-oriented library like Liberator, Clojure offers a range of options to suit your needs.

### Exercises

1. **Experiment with Luminus**: Create a new Luminus project and add a database connection. Implement a simple CRUD application.
2. **Build a Pedestal Service**: Develop a Pedestal service that handles both GET and POST requests. Implement custom interceptors for request validation.
