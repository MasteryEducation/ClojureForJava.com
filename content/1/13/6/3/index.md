## 13.6.3 Authorization and Access Control

In the realm of web development, ensuring that users have appropriate access to resources is crucial for maintaining security and integrity. Authorization and access control are key components of this process. In this section, we'll explore how to implement these concepts in Clojure web applications, drawing parallels with Java to ease the transition for experienced Java developers.

### Understanding Authorization and Access Control

**Authorization** is the process of determining whether a user has permission to perform a specific action or access a particular resource. This is typically based on user roles or permissions. **Access Control** refers to the mechanisms that enforce these authorization rules.

In Java, you might be familiar with frameworks like Spring Security, which provides comprehensive tools for managing authentication and authorization. In Clojure, we often use middleware to achieve similar functionality, leveraging the language's functional programming paradigms.

### Key Concepts in Authorization

1. **Roles and Permissions**: Users are assigned roles, and roles are granted permissions. This allows for flexible and scalable access control.
2. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Define which roles have access to specific resources or actions.
3. **Middleware**: In Clojure, middleware functions are used to intercept requests and apply authorization logic.

### Implementing Authorization in Clojure

Let's dive into implementing authorization in a Clojure web application. We'll use the popular **Ring** and **Compojure** libraries to handle HTTP requests and routing.

#### Defining Roles and Permissions

First, we need to define the roles and permissions for our application. This can be done using simple data structures in Clojure.

```clojure
(def roles
  {:admin #{:read :write :delete}
   :user #{:read}
   :guest #{}})

(defn has-permission? [role permission]
  (contains? (get roles role) permission))
```

In this example, we define a map `roles` where each key is a role and the value is a set of permissions associated with that role. The `has-permission?` function checks if a given role has a specific permission.

#### Applying Authorization in Middleware

Middleware in Clojure is a function that takes a handler and returns a new handler. We can use middleware to enforce authorization rules.

```clojure
(defn wrap-authorization [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [user-role (:role (:session request))
          required-permission (:permission (:route request))]
      (if (has-permission? user-role required-permission)
        (handler request)
        {:status 403
         :body "Forbidden"}))))
```

The `wrap-authorization` middleware extracts the user's role from the session and the required permission from the route. It then checks if the user has the necessary permission to proceed.

#### Integrating with Routes

Now, let's integrate our authorization middleware with Compojure routes.

```clojure
(require '[compojure.core :refer :all])

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/admin" request
       :permission :write
       (wrap-authorization
         (fn [req] {:status 200 :body "Welcome, Admin!"})))
  (GET "/user" request
       :permission :read
       (wrap-authorization
         (fn [req] {:status 200 :body "Welcome, User!"}))))
```

Here, we define routes with specific permissions required for access. The `wrap-authorization` middleware ensures that only users with the appropriate permissions can access these routes.

### Comparing with Java

In Java, you might use annotations or XML configuration to define access control rules. Clojure's approach is more dynamic and flexible, allowing you to define rules programmatically and apply them using middleware.

#### Java Example

```java
import org.springframework.security.access.annotation.Secured;

@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")
    @GetMapping("/admin")
    public String adminAccess() {
        return "Welcome, Admin!";
    }

    @Secured("ROLE_USER")
    @GetMapping("/user")
    public String userAccess() {
        return "Welcome, User!";
    }
}
```

In this Java example, we use the `@Secured` annotation to specify the roles required for each endpoint. This is similar to specifying permissions in Clojure routes.

### Advanced Authorization Techniques

#### Role Hierarchies

In some cases, roles may inherit permissions from other roles. This can be implemented using a hierarchy.

```clojure
(def role-hierarchy
  {:admin [:user]
   :user [:guest]})

(defn inherited-permissions [role]
  (let [base-permissions (get roles role)
        inherited-roles (get role-hierarchy role)]
    (reduce #(clojure.set/union %1 (get roles %2)) base-permissions inherited-roles)))

(defn has-inherited-permission? [role permission]
  (contains? (inherited-permissions role) permission))
```

This code defines a role hierarchy and a function to compute inherited permissions. The `has-inherited-permission?` function checks permissions, considering both direct and inherited permissions.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC is a more granular approach that considers user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions.

```clojure
(defn abac-authorize [user resource action]
  (and (= (:role user) :admin)
       (= (:resource-type resource) :confidential)
       (= action :read)))
```

In this example, we define an ABAC rule that allows admins to read confidential resources.

### Visualizing Authorization Flow

Below is a flowchart illustrating the authorization process in a Clojure web application.

```mermaid

    A[Incoming Request] --> B{Check Session}
    B -->|Valid Session| C{Extract Role}
    B -->|Invalid Session| E[Redirect to Login]
    C --> D{Check Permissions}
    D -->|Authorized| F[Proceed to Handler]
    D -->|Unauthorized| G[Return 403 Forbidden]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart shows the steps involved in processing an incoming request, checking the session, extracting the user role, and verifying permissions before proceeding to the request handler or returning a forbidden response.

### Best Practices for Authorization

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review roles and permissions to ensure they align with current security policies.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep authorization logic separate from business logic to maintain clean and maintainable code.
- **Use Libraries**: Consider using libraries like [Friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend) for more complex authorization needs.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the code examples provided. Try adding new roles and permissions, or implement a custom middleware to log unauthorized access attempts. Consider how you might integrate these concepts into a larger application.

### Exercises

1. **Implement a New Role**: Add a new role called `:editor` with permissions to `:read` and `:write`. Update the middleware and routes to accommodate this role.
2. **ABAC Rule**: Create an ABAC rule that allows users to delete resources only if they are the owner.
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Modify the role hierarchy to allow `:editor` to inherit permissions from `:user`.

### Key Takeaways

- Authorization and access control are essential for securing web applications.
- Clojure's functional programming paradigm offers a flexible and dynamic approach to implementing these concepts.
- Middleware is a powerful tool for enforcing authorization rules in Clojure.
