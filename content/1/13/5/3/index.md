## 13.5.3 Writing Custom Middleware

Middleware in web development acts as a bridge between the HTTP request and the application logic. It is used to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, request throttling, and request/response transformation. In Clojure, middleware is a powerful concept that allows developers to compose web applications in a modular and reusable way. In this section, we will explore how to write custom middleware in Clojure, drawing parallels to Java concepts where applicable.

### Understanding Middleware in Clojure

In Clojure, middleware is a higher-order function that takes a handler function and returns a new handler function. This new handler can modify the request before passing it to the original handler or modify the response before returning it to the client. This concept is similar to Java's servlet filters, which intercept requests and responses to apply cross-cutting concerns.

#### Middleware Structure

A typical middleware function in Clojure looks like this:

```clojure
(defn wrap-example-middleware [handler]
  (fn [request]
    ;; Pre-processing the request
    (let [modified-request (assoc request :example-key "example-value")]
      ;; Call the original handler with the modified request
      (let [response (handler modified-request)]
        ;; Post-processing the response
        (assoc response :example-header "example-value")))))
```

- **Pre-processing**: Modify the incoming request before passing it to the handler.
- **Post-processing**: Modify the response before sending it back to the client.

### Writing Custom Middleware

Let's create a custom middleware that logs requests and responses. This middleware will demonstrate how to intercept and log HTTP requests and responses, a common requirement in web applications.

#### Step 1: Define the Middleware Function

First, we define a middleware function `wrap-logger` that logs the request method and URI, as well as the response status.

```clojure
(defn wrap-logger [handler]
  (fn [request]
    ;; Log the incoming request
    (println "Request:" (:request-method request) (:uri request))
    ;; Call the original handler
    (let [response (handler request)]
      ;; Log the response status
      (println "Response status:" (:status response))
      ;; Return the response
      response)))
```

#### Step 2: Apply the Middleware

To apply the middleware, we wrap it around our handler function. In a Clojure web application, handlers are typically defined using libraries like Ring and Compojure.

```clojure
(require '[ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
         '[ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]])

(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})

(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-logger
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

(run-jetty app {:port 3000})
```

In this example, `wrap-logger` is applied to the `handler`, and the resulting application is run on a Jetty server.

### Middleware for Authentication

Authentication is another common use case for middleware. Let's create a simple authentication middleware that checks for a specific header in the request.

#### Step 1: Define the Authentication Middleware

```clojure
(defn wrap-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (if (= "secret-token" (get-in request [:headers "authorization"]))
      (handler request)
      {:status 401
       :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
       :body "Unauthorized"})))
```

This middleware checks if the `authorization` header contains the value `"secret-token"`. If it does, the request is passed to the handler; otherwise, a 401 Unauthorized response is returned.

#### Step 2: Apply the Authentication Middleware

```clojure
(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-authentication
      wrap-logger
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

(run-jetty app {:port 3000})
```

Here, `wrap-authentication` is applied before `wrap-logger`, ensuring that only authenticated requests are logged.

### Request Throttling Middleware

Request throttling is used to limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period. Let's implement a simple throttling middleware.

#### Step 1: Define the Throttling Middleware

```clojure
(def request-count (atom {}))

(defn wrap-throttle [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [client-ip (:remote-addr request)
          current-count (get @request-count client-ip 0)]
      (if (< current-count 10)
        (do
          (swap! request-count update client-ip (fnil inc 0))
          (handler request))
        {:status 429
         :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
         :body "Too Many Requests"}))))
```

This middleware uses an atom to keep track of the number of requests from each client IP. If the count exceeds 10, a 429 Too Many Requests response is returned.

#### Step 2: Apply the Throttling Middleware

```clojure
(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-throttle
      wrap-authentication
      wrap-logger
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

(run-jetty app {:port 3000})
```

### Request/Response Transformation Middleware

Sometimes, you may need to transform requests or responses. Let's create middleware that adds a custom header to every response.

#### Step 1: Define the Transformation Middleware

```clojure
(defn wrap-custom-header [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [response (handler request)]
      (assoc-in response [:headers "X-Custom-Header"] "CustomValue"))))
```

This middleware adds an `X-Custom-Header` to every response.

#### Step 2: Apply the Transformation Middleware

```clojure
(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-custom-header
      wrap-throttle
      wrap-authentication
      wrap-logger
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)))

(run-jetty app {:port 3000})
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored several examples of custom middleware, try modifying the code to:

- Log additional request details, such as headers or query parameters.
- Implement a more sophisticated authentication mechanism, such as checking a database.
- Enhance the throttling middleware to reset counts after a certain time period.

### Visualizing Middleware Flow

To better understand how middleware functions are composed and executed, let's visualize the flow of data through middleware layers.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Incoming Request] --> B[wrap-authentication]
    B --> C{Authenticated?}
    C -->|Yes| D[wrap-throttle]
    C -->|No| E[Return 401 Unauthorized]
    D --> F{Request Limit?}
    F -->|Yes| G[wrap-logger]
    F -->|No| H[Return 429 Too Many Requests]
    G --> I[wrap-custom-header]
    I --> J[Handler]
    J --> K[Response]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the sequence of middleware execution. The request passes through authentication, throttling, logging, and custom header middleware before reaching the handler. Each middleware layer can modify the request or response.

### Key Takeaways

- **Middleware Composition**: Middleware in Clojure is composed by wrapping handler functions, allowing for modular and reusable code.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Middleware is ideal for handling cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and request transformation.
- **Functional Approach**: Clojure's functional programming paradigm makes middleware composition intuitive and powerful.
- **Customization**: Custom middleware can be tailored to meet specific application needs, enhancing flexibility and control.

### Exercises

1. **Enhance Logging Middleware**: Modify the `wrap-logger` middleware to log request headers and response times.
2. **Advanced Authentication**: Implement middleware that checks a user's role and restricts access to certain endpoints.
3. **Dynamic Throttling**: Create a throttling middleware that adjusts limits based on user roles or IP addresses.
4. **Response Compression**: Write middleware that compresses responses for clients that support it.
