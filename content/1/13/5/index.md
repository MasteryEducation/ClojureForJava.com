## 13.5 Additional Practice Problems

As you continue your journey into the world of Clojure, it's essential to apply the concepts you've learned in practical, real-world scenarios. This section presents a series of practice problems designed to challenge your understanding and help you gain hands-on experience with Clojure. These exercises will not only solidify your grasp of functional programming but also enhance your ability to integrate Clojure with Java, leveraging the strengths of both languages.

### Building a Todo App

Creating a todo application is a classic exercise that helps you understand the fundamental aspects of application development, such as data management, user interaction, and state handling. In Clojure, you'll explore how immutability and functional paradigms can simplify these tasks.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define the Data Model**: Start by defining the data structure for a todo item. Use a map to represent each item, with keys for the task description, completion status, and any other relevant information.

   ```clojure
   (def todo-item {:description "Learn Clojure" :completed false})
   ```

2. **Create a List of Todos**: Use a vector to store multiple todo items. This collection will represent the entire list of tasks.

   ```clojure
   (def todo-list [])
   ```

3. **Add a New Todo**: Implement a function to add a new todo item to the list. This function should return a new list with the added item, maintaining immutability.

   ```clojure
   (defn add-todo [todos description]
     (conj todos {:description description :completed false}))
   ```

4. **Mark a Todo as Completed**: Write a function to update the completion status of a todo item. Use the `assoc` function to modify the map within the vector.

   ```clojure
   (defn complete-todo [todos index]
     (assoc-in todos [index :completed] true))
   ```

5. **Display the Todo List**: Create a function to print the list of todos, showing their status and description.

   ```clojure
   (defn display-todos [todos]
     (doseq [todo todos]
       (println (str (if (:completed todo) "[x] " "[ ] ")
                     (:description todo)))))
   ```

6. **Interactive REPL**: Use the REPL to interactively test your functions. Add, complete, and display todos to ensure everything works as expected.

#### Best Practices

- **Immutability**: Always return a new list when modifying the todo list to preserve immutability.
- **Functional Design**: Keep functions pure and avoid side effects. This approach simplifies testing and debugging.

### Creating a Simple Game

Developing a simple game is an excellent way to explore Clojure's capabilities in handling state, user input, and game logic. We'll create a text-based number guessing game.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Game Setup**: Define the initial state of the game, including the target number and the number of attempts.

   ```clojure
   (defn init-game []
     {:target (rand-int 100)
      :attempts 0})
   ```

2. **User Input**: Implement a function to read user input from the console. Use `read-line` to capture the player's guess.

   ```clojure
   (defn get-guess []
     (println "Enter your guess:")
     (Integer. (read-line)))
   ```

3. **Game Logic**: Write a function to compare the player's guess with the target number. Provide feedback and update the game state accordingly.

   ```clojure
   (defn check-guess [game-state guess]
     (let [target (:target game-state)]
       (cond
         (= guess target) (println "Correct! You win!")
         (< guess target) (println "Too low!")
         :else (println "Too high!"))
       (update game-state :attempts inc)))
   ```

4. **Game Loop**: Create a loop to repeatedly prompt the player for guesses until they win. Use recursion to manage the game state.

   ```clojure
   (defn play-game [game-state]
     (let [guess (get-guess)]
       (if (= guess (:target game-state))
         (println "Congratulations! You've guessed the number!")
         (recur (check-guess game-state guess)))))
   ```

5. **Start the Game**: Initialize the game state and start the game loop.

   ```clojure
   (defn start-game []
     (play-game (init-game)))
   ```

#### Best Practices

- **State Management**: Use immutable data structures to represent the game state, ensuring that each state change is explicit and traceable.
- **Recursion**: Leverage recursion for looping constructs, avoiding mutable variables and side effects.

### Developing a Data Analysis Tool

Building a data analysis tool allows you to apply Clojure's powerful data manipulation capabilities. We'll create a tool to process and analyze CSV data.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Read CSV Data**: Use the `clojure.data.csv` library to read CSV files into a collection of maps, where each map represents a row.

   ```clojure
   (require '[clojure.data.csv :as csv]
            '[clojure.java.io :as io])

   (defn read-csv [file-path]
     (with-open [reader (io/reader file-path)]
       (doall
         (csv/read-csv reader :header true))))
   ```

2. **Filter Data**: Implement a function to filter rows based on a specific condition. Use `filter` to select rows that meet the criteria.

   ```clojure
   (defn filter-data [data condition]
     (filter condition data))
   ```

3. **Aggregate Data**: Write a function to aggregate data, such as calculating the sum or average of a column. Use `reduce` to perform the aggregation.

   ```clojure
   (defn sum-column [data column-key]
     (reduce + (map #(get % column-key) data)))
   ```

4. **Visualize Data**: Use a library like `incanter` to create visualizations, such as bar charts or line graphs, to represent the analyzed data.

   ```clojure
   (require '[incanter.core :as incanter]
            '[incanter.charts :as charts])

   (defn plot-data [data x-key y-key]
     (let [chart (charts/bar-chart (map x-key data) (map y-key data))]
       (incanter/view chart)))
   ```

5. **Interactive Analysis**: Provide a REPL interface for users to load data, apply filters, perform aggregations, and visualize results.

#### Best Practices

- **Data Transformation**: Use Clojure's rich set of functions for data transformation, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, to process data efficiently.
- **Modular Design**: Organize your code into reusable functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the analysis.

### Additional Challenges

To further enhance your skills, consider tackling these additional challenges:

- **RESTful API Client**: Build a client to interact with a RESTful API, fetching and processing data.
- **Concurrency with Core.async**: Implement a concurrent program using Clojure's `core.async` library to manage asynchronous tasks.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Develop algorithms to process and analyze graph data structures, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

### Conclusion

These practice problems are designed to deepen your understanding of Clojure and its functional programming paradigm. By tackling these challenges, you'll gain valuable experience in building applications, managing state, and processing data. Remember to leverage Clojure's strengths, such as immutability and higher-order functions, to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
