## 13.3.2 Handling HTTP Requests

Handling HTTP requests is a fundamental aspect of building web applications. In Clojure, this is typically done using libraries such as Ring and Compojure, which provide a simple and elegant way to create web servers and define routes. This section will guide you through the process of setting up handlers for different endpoints and returning appropriate HTTP responses, with a focus on leveraging the power of Clojure's functional programming paradigm.

### Introduction to Ring and Compojure

Ring is a Clojure library that abstracts the HTTP protocol and provides a simple interface for building web applications. It follows a middleware pattern, allowing you to compose your application from smaller, reusable components. Compojure is a routing library built on top of Ring, which makes it easy to define routes and handle requests.

#### Setting Up Your Project

Before diving into handling HTTP requests, let's set up a basic Clojure project using Leiningen, a popular build tool for Clojure.

1. **Create a New Project:**

   ```bash
   lein new app my-web-app
   ```

2. **Add Dependencies:**

   Open the `project.clj` file and add Ring and Compojure to the dependencies:

   ```clojure
   :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                  [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]
                  [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.9.0"]
                  [compojure "1.6.2"]]
   ```

3. **Create a Basic Server:**

   In the `src/my_web_app/core.clj` file, set up a basic Ring server:

   ```clojure
   (ns my-web-app.core
     (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
               [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET POST]]
               [ring.util.response :refer [response]]))

   (defn handler [request]
     (response "Hello, World!"))

   (defroutes app-routes
     (GET "/" [] handler))

   (defn -main [& args]
     (run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000 :join? false}))
   ```

   This code sets up a simple server that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed at the root URL.

### Creating Handlers for Different Endpoints

In a real-world application, you'll need to handle various types of requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Compojure makes it easy to define routes and associate them with handler functions.

#### Defining Routes

Routes in Compojure are defined using macros such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. Each macro takes a path and a handler function.

```clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] (response "Welcome to the home page!"))
  (GET "/about" [] (response "About us"))
  (POST "/submit" req (handle-submit req))
  (PUT "/update" req (handle-update req))
  (DELETE "/delete" req (handle-delete req)))
```

#### Creating Handler Functions

Handler functions take a request map as an argument and return a response map. The request map contains information about the HTTP request, such as headers, parameters, and the request body.

```clojure
(defn handle-submit [req]
  (let [params (:params req)]
    (response (str "Received submission: " params))))

(defn handle-update [req]
  (response "Update successful"))

(defn handle-delete [req]
  (response "Resource deleted"))
```

### Returning Appropriate HTTP Responses

In Clojure, HTTP responses are typically constructed using the `ring.util.response` namespace, which provides functions for creating response maps.

#### Basic Response

A basic response can be created using the `response` function, which takes a body and returns a response map with a 200 status code.

```clojure
(response "This is a basic response")
```

#### Customizing Status Codes

You can customize the status code of a response using the `status` function.

```clojure
(status (response "Resource not found") 404)
```

#### Adding Headers

Headers can be added to a response using the `header` function.

```clojure
(header (response "Hello, World!") "Content-Type" "text/plain")
```

#### Returning JSON Responses

To return JSON responses, you can use the `cheshire` library to encode data as JSON.

1. **Add Cheshire to Dependencies:**

   ```clojure
   [cheshire "5.10.0"]
   ```

2. **Encode Data as JSON:**

   ```clojure
   (require '[cheshire.core :as json])

   (defn json-response [data]
     (-> (response (json/generate-string data))
         (header "Content-Type" "application/json")))

   (GET "/data" [] (json-response {:name "Clojure" :type "Language"}))
   ```

### Middleware and Interceptors

Middleware functions in Ring are used to process requests and responses. They can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, and modifying request/response data.

#### Example: Logging Middleware

```clojure
(defn wrap-logging [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (println "Request received:" request)
    (let [response (handler request)]
      (println "Response sent:" response)
      response)))

(def app
  (-> app-routes
      wrap-logging))
```

### Best Practices for Handling HTTP Requests

1. **Use Middleware for Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

   Middleware is ideal for handling concerns that affect multiple endpoints, such as authentication and logging.

2. **Keep Handlers Simple:**

   Handlers should focus on processing requests and generating responses. Business logic should be extracted into separate functions or services.

3. **Return Consistent Responses:**

   Ensure that your API returns consistent responses, with appropriate status codes and error messages.

4. **Use JSON for Data Interchange:**

   JSON is a widely-used format for data interchange. Use libraries like Cheshire to serialize and deserialize JSON data.

5. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**

   Use middleware to catch exceptions and return meaningful error responses.

### Common Pitfalls and Optimization Tips

- **Avoid Blocking Operations:** Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks to prevent blocking the server.
- **Optimize Middleware Order:** The order of middleware can affect performance. Place frequently-used middleware early in the chain.
- **Profile and Monitor Performance:** Use tools like YourKit or VisualVM to profile your application and identify bottlenecks.

### Advanced Topics

For more advanced applications, consider using libraries like Pedestal or Luminus, which provide additional features and abstractions for building web applications.

### Conclusion

Handling HTTP requests in Clojure is a powerful and flexible process, thanks to libraries like Ring and Compojure. By understanding how to create handlers, define routes, and return appropriate responses, you can build robust and scalable web applications. Remember to leverage middleware for cross-cutting concerns and keep your handlers focused on processing requests.
