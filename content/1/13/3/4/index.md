## 13.3.4 Versioning and Documentation

In the realm of web development, especially when building RESTful APIs, versioning and documentation are crucial for maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring that developers can easily understand and use your API. In this section, we'll explore strategies for API versioning, introduce tools for API documentation such as Swagger and OpenAPI, and explain how to document APIs built with Clojure.

### Understanding API Versioning

API versioning is the practice of managing changes to your API without disrupting existing clients. As your API evolves, you may need to introduce new features, deprecate old ones, or fix bugs. Versioning allows you to make these changes while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Why Version Your API?

- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensures existing clients continue to function without modification.
- **Controlled Evolution**: Allows you to introduce new features and improvements without breaking existing functionality.
- **Clear Communication**: Provides a clear indication of changes and updates to your API.

#### Common Versioning Strategies

1. **URI Versioning**: Include the version number in the URL path.
   - Example: `/api/v1/resource`
   - **Pros**: Easy to implement and understand.
   - **Cons**: Can lead to URL clutter and requires changes to client code for version upgrades.

2. **Query Parameter Versioning**: Use a query parameter to specify the version.
   - Example: `/api/resource?version=1`
   - **Pros**: Keeps URLs clean and allows for flexible versioning.
   - **Cons**: Can be overlooked by clients and may complicate caching.

3. **Header Versioning**: Specify the version in the HTTP headers.
   - Example: `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`
   - **Pros**: Keeps URLs clean and allows for content negotiation.
   - **Cons**: Requires clients to handle headers, which can be complex.

4. **Content Negotiation**: Use the `Accept` header to specify the version.
   - Example: `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`
   - **Pros**: Allows for flexible versioning and content negotiation.
   - **Cons**: Can be complex to implement and requires client support.

#### Best Practices for API Versioning

- **Plan for Versioning Early**: Even if you start with a single version, plan for future versions.
- **Communicate Changes Clearly**: Use documentation and changelogs to communicate changes to your API.
- **Deprecate Responsibly**: Provide a clear deprecation policy and timeline for old versions.
- **Test Across Versions**: Ensure that all versions of your API are thoroughly tested.

### Implementing API Versioning in Clojure

Let's explore how to implement API versioning in a Clojure web application using the Compojure framework.

#### Example: URI Versioning with Compojure

```clojure
(ns myapp.routes
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [ring.util.response :refer :all]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/api/v1/resource" [] (response "Version 1 of the resource"))
  (GET "/api/v2/resource" [] (response "Version 2 of the resource")))

(def app
  (wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults))
```

In this example, we define two versions of the same resource using different URI paths. Clients can access the desired version by specifying the appropriate path.

#### Try It Yourself

- Modify the example to add a new version of the resource.
- Implement query parameter versioning by checking for a `version` parameter in the request.

### Documenting APIs with Swagger and OpenAPI

API documentation is essential for helping developers understand how to use your API. Swagger and OpenAPI are popular tools for creating interactive API documentation.

#### Introduction to Swagger and OpenAPI

- **Swagger**: A set of open-source tools for building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs.
- **OpenAPI**: A specification for defining APIs, which Swagger uses to generate documentation.

#### Benefits of Using Swagger and OpenAPI

- **Interactive Documentation**: Provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and testing your API.
- **Standardized Format**: Ensures consistency and compatibility across different tools and platforms.
- **Automated Documentation**: Reduces the manual effort required to document your API.

#### Setting Up Swagger with Clojure

To document a Clojure API using Swagger, we can use the `ring-swagger` library, which integrates with Compojure and provides tools for generating Swagger documentation.

##### Example: Documenting a Clojure API with Swagger

```clojure
(ns myapp.swagger
  (:require [compojure.api.sweet :refer :all]
            [ring.util.http-response :refer :all]
            [schema.core :as s]))

(s/defschema Resource
  {:id s/Int
   :name s/Str})

(defapi app
  (swagger-ui)
  (swagger-docs
    {:info {:title "My API"
            :description "API documentation with Swagger"}})

  (context "/api" []
    :tags ["resource"]

    (GET "/v1/resource" []
      :return Resource
      :summary "Get a resource"
      (ok {:id 1 :name "Resource V1"}))

    (GET "/v2/resource" []
      :return Resource
      :summary "Get a resource"
      (ok {:id 2 :name "Resource V2"}))))
```

In this example, we define a simple API with two versions of a resource. The `swagger-ui` and `swagger-docs` functions generate interactive documentation for the API.

##### Try It Yourself

- Add a new endpoint to the API and update the Swagger documentation.
- Experiment with different data schemas and see how they appear in the documentation.

### Comparing Clojure and Java for API Documentation

Java developers may be familiar with tools like Javadoc for documenting code. While Javadoc is excellent for documenting Java classes and methods, Swagger and OpenAPI provide a more interactive and comprehensive approach to documenting RESTful APIs.

#### Key Differences

- **Interactivity**: Swagger provides an interactive interface for testing API endpoints, whereas Javadoc is static.
- **Standardization**: OpenAPI is a widely adopted standard for API documentation, ensuring compatibility with various tools.
- **Automation**: Swagger can automatically generate documentation from code annotations, reducing manual effort.

### Best Practices for API Documentation

- **Keep Documentation Up-to-Date**: Regularly update your documentation to reflect changes in the API.
- **Use Clear and Concise Language**: Write documentation that is easy to understand and free of jargon.
- **Provide Examples**: Include examples of API requests and responses to help developers understand how to use your API.
- **Organize Documentation Logically**: Structure your documentation in a way that is easy to navigate.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Implement Versioning**: Add versioning to an existing Clojure API using one of the strategies discussed.
2. **Document an API**: Use Swagger to document a simple Clojure API with multiple endpoints.
3. **Compare Tools**: Research and compare other API documentation tools and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

### Key Takeaways

- **Versioning** is essential for maintaining backward compatibility and managing API changes.
- **Swagger and OpenAPI** provide powerful tools for creating interactive and standardized API documentation.
- **Clojure** offers libraries like `ring-swagger` to integrate Swagger documentation into your web applications.
- **Best Practices** include keeping documentation up-to-date, using clear language, and providing examples.

By understanding and implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your Clojure APIs are both robust and easy to use, facilitating smooth integration and adoption by developers.
