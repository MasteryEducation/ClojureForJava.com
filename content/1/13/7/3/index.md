## 13.7.3 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Libraries

In the realm of web development, interacting with databases is a fundamental task. For Java developers, frameworks like Hibernate provide a robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution that abstracts SQL complexities. In Clojure, while the language itself encourages a more functional approach, ORM libraries like **Korma** and **Yesql** offer higher-level abstractions over SQL, making database operations more intuitive and less error-prone. This section will delve into these libraries, illustrating how they can simplify database interactions and when to use them effectively.

### Understanding ORM in Clojure

Before diving into specific libraries, let's briefly discuss the concept of ORM. ORM libraries map database tables to objects in your code, allowing you to interact with your database using the programming language's constructs rather than raw SQL. This abstraction can lead to more readable and maintainable code.

In Clojure, the functional paradigm encourages immutability and data transformation, which can be at odds with traditional ORM practices that often involve mutable state. However, Clojure's ORM libraries are designed to integrate seamlessly with its functional nature, providing a balance between abstraction and control.

### Korma: A Declarative Approach to SQL

**Korma** is a popular ORM library in the Clojure ecosystem. It provides a declarative syntax for building SQL queries, making it easier to construct complex queries without writing raw SQL. Korma focuses on simplicity and readability, aligning well with Clojure's philosophy.

#### Setting Up Korma

To get started with Korma, you'll need to add it to your project dependencies. Here's how you can do it using Leiningen:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [korma "0.4.3"]
                 [org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.5"]]) ; Example for PostgreSQL
```

#### Defining Database Connections

Korma requires you to define a database connection, which you can do using the `defdb` macro. Here's an example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.db
  (:require [korma.db :refer :all]))

(defdb mydb (postgres {:db "mydatabase"
                       :user "myuser"
                       :password "mypassword"
                       :host "localhost"}))
```

#### Defining Entities

Entities in Korma represent tables in your database. You define them using the `defentity` macro. Here's how you can define an entity for a `users` table:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.models
  (:require [korma.core :refer :all]
            [my-clojure-app.db :refer :all]))

(defentity users)
```

#### Querying with Korma

Korma provides a fluent API for building queries. Here's an example of a simple query to fetch all users:

```clojure
(select users)
```

You can also build more complex queries using functions like `where`, `order`, and `limit`:

```clojure
(select users
  (where {:age [> 18]})
  (order :name :asc)
  (limit 10))
```

#### Inserting, Updating, and Deleting

Korma makes it easy to perform insert, update, and delete operations:

```clojure
;; Insert a new user
(insert users
  (values {:name "Alice" :age 30}))

;; Update a user's age
(update users
  (set-fields {:age 31})
  (where {:name "Alice"}))

;; Delete a user
(delete users
  (where {:name "Alice"}))
```

### Yesql: SQL as Data

**Yesql** takes a different approach by treating SQL queries as data. It allows you to write SQL queries in separate files and use them in your Clojure code. This approach can be beneficial for developers who prefer writing raw SQL but still want the convenience of integrating it with Clojure.

#### Setting Up Yesql

To use Yesql, add it to your project dependencies:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [yesql "0.5.3"]
                 [org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.5"]])
```

#### Writing SQL Queries

With Yesql, you write your SQL queries in separate files. For example, create a file named `queries.sql`:

```sql
-- name: get-users-by-age
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > :age;

-- name: insert-user! :! :n
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (:name, :age);
```

#### Using Yesql in Clojure

You can load these queries into your Clojure code using the `defqueries` macro:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.models
  (:require [yesql.core :refer [defqueries]]
            [my-clojure-app.db :refer :all]))

(defqueries "queries.sql")
```

Now you can use the queries as functions in your code:

```clojure
;; Fetch users older than 18
(get-users-by-age {:age 18})

;; Insert a new user
(insert-user! {:name "Bob" :age 25})
```

### Comparing Korma and Yesql

Both Korma and Yesql offer unique advantages depending on your project's needs:

- **Korma**: Ideal for developers who prefer a more declarative, Clojure-like syntax for building queries. It abstracts SQL into a fluent API, making it easier to construct and maintain complex queries.

- **Yesql**: Suitable for those who prefer writing raw SQL and want to keep SQL logic separate from application logic. It allows for greater flexibility and control over SQL queries.

Here's a comparison table to summarize their differences:

| Feature         | Korma                        | Yesql                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Approach**    | Declarative, Fluent API      | SQL as Data                |
| **Syntax**      | Clojure-like                 | Raw SQL                    |
| **Flexibility** | Moderate                     | High                       |
| **Use Case**    | Complex queries, Clojure devs| SQL-heavy applications     |

### When to Use ORM Libraries

ORM libraries like Korma and Yesql can significantly simplify database interactions, but they are not always the best choice for every project. Consider using them when:

- **You need to abstract complex SQL logic**: ORM libraries can simplify the construction and maintenance of complex queries.
- **You want to improve code readability**: By abstracting SQL, ORM libraries can make your codebase more readable and maintainable.
- **You prefer a functional approach**: Clojure's ORM libraries are designed to integrate with its functional paradigm, offering a more idiomatic way to handle database operations.

However, if your application requires highly optimized SQL queries or you need to leverage specific database features, writing raw SQL might be more appropriate.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience with Korma and Yesql, try modifying the code examples provided:

- **Experiment with different query conditions**: Modify the `where` clause in Korma or the SQL queries in Yesql to filter data differently.
- **Add new fields to the database**: Extend the `users` table with additional fields and update the queries accordingly.
- **Combine Korma and Yesql**: Use both libraries in a single project to see how they complement each other.

### Exercises

1. **Create a new entity in Korma**: Define a new entity for a `products` table and write queries to insert, update, and delete products.
2. **Write a complex SQL query in Yesql**: Create a query that joins multiple tables and filters results based on specific criteria.
3. **Compare performance**: Measure the performance of queries executed with Korma and Yesql and analyze the results.

### Key Takeaways

- **Korma and Yesql provide higher-level abstractions** over SQL, making database operations in Clojure more intuitive.
- **Korma offers a declarative, fluent API**, while Yesql treats SQL as data, allowing for greater flexibility.
- **Choose the right tool for your project** based on your team's preferences and the complexity of your database interactions.

By understanding and leveraging these ORM libraries, you can streamline your database operations in Clojure, making your applications more robust and maintainable.
