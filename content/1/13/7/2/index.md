## 13.7.2 Introducing Next.jdbc

As experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, you may be familiar with the intricacies of database interactions using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). In the Clojure ecosystem, `clojure.java.jdbc` has been a popular choice for database operations. However, a newer library, `next.jdbc`, has emerged as a more modern and efficient alternative. In this section, we'll explore `next.jdbc`, highlighting its advantages in terms of simplicity and performance, and provide practical examples to demonstrate its usage.

### Why Choose Next.jdbc?

`next.jdbc` was designed to address some of the limitations and complexities of `clojure.java.jdbc`. Here are some key reasons why you might consider using `next.jdbc` for your Clojure projects:

- **Simplicity**: `next.jdbc` offers a more straightforward API, making it easier to perform common database operations without boilerplate code.
- **Performance**: It is optimized for performance, leveraging the latest JDBC features and best practices.
- **Flexibility**: The library provides flexible options for handling result sets and transactions, allowing you to tailor database interactions to your specific needs.
- **Modern Design**: Built with a focus on immutability and functional programming principles, `next.jdbc` aligns well with Clojure's philosophy.

### Getting Started with Next.jdbc

Before diving into code examples, let's set up `next.jdbc` in your Clojure project. You'll need to add the library as a dependency in your `deps.edn` or `project.clj` file, depending on whether you're using `tools.deps` or Leiningen.

#### Adding Next.jdbc to Your Project

For `tools.deps`, add the following to your `deps.edn`:

```clojure
{:deps {seancorfield/next.jdbc {:mvn/version "1.2.780"}}}
```

For Leiningen, add this to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[seancorfield/next.jdbc "1.2.780"]]
```

### Establishing a Database Connection

In `next.jdbc`, establishing a connection to the database is straightforward. You typically use a database specification map to define your connection parameters.

Here's a simple example of connecting to a PostgreSQL database:

```clojure
(require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "postgresql"
   :dbname "mydatabase"
   :host "localhost"
   :user "myuser"
   :password "mypassword"})

(def datasource (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec))
```

**Explanation**: 
- `db-spec` is a map containing the database connection details.
- `jdbc/get-datasource` creates a connection pool, which is more efficient for handling multiple database requests.

### Performing Basic CRUD Operations

With the connection established, let's explore how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using `next.jdbc`.

#### Creating Records

To insert a new record into a database table, you can use the `jdbc/execute!` function:

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! datasource
               ["INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)" "Alice" "alice@example.com"])
```

**Explanation**: 
- The SQL query is parameterized using `?`, which helps prevent SQL injection attacks.
- The values to be inserted are provided as a vector following the SQL string.

#### Reading Records

To retrieve data from the database, use the `jdbc/execute!` function with a `SELECT` query:

```clojure
(def users (jdbc/execute! datasource ["SELECT * FROM users"]))

;; Print the retrieved users
(prn users)
```

**Explanation**: 
- The result is a vector of maps, where each map represents a row in the result set.

#### Updating Records

Updating records is similar to inserting them. Use the `jdbc/execute!` function with an `UPDATE` query:

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! datasource
               ["UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE name = ?" "alice@newdomain.com" "Alice"])
```

**Explanation**: 
- The query updates the email of the user named Alice.

#### Deleting Records

To delete records, use the `jdbc/execute!` function with a `DELETE` query:

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! datasource ["DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ?" "Alice"])
```

**Explanation**: 
- This query deletes the user named Alice from the database.

### Handling Transactions

Transactions are crucial for ensuring data integrity. `next.jdbc` provides a simple way to manage transactions using the `jdbc/with-transaction` macro.

Here's an example of using a transaction to ensure multiple operations are atomic:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-transaction [tx datasource]
  (jdbc/execute! tx ["INSERT INTO accounts (name, balance) VALUES (?, ?)" "Bob" 1000])
  (jdbc/execute! tx ["UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE name = ?" 100 "Alice"]))
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `jdbc/with-transaction` macro ensures that both operations are committed together. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.

### Advanced Features of Next.jdbc

`next.jdbc` offers several advanced features that enhance its flexibility and performance.

#### Customizing Result Set Handling

By default, `next.jdbc` returns result sets as vectors of maps. However, you can customize this behavior using the `:builder-fn` option.

For example, to return results as a sequence of vectors:

```clojure
(def users (jdbc/execute! datasource
                          ["SELECT * FROM users"]
                          {:builder-fn jdbc/as-arrays}))

(prn users)
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `jdbc/as-arrays` function changes the result set format to a sequence of vectors.

#### Using Prepared Statements

Prepared statements can improve performance and security. `next.jdbc` supports prepared statements through the `jdbc/prepare` function.

Here's how to use a prepared statement to insert a record:

```clojure
(let [stmt (jdbc/prepare datasource ["INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)"])]
  (jdbc/execute! stmt ["Charlie" "charlie@example.com"]))
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `jdbc/prepare` function creates a prepared statement, which can be executed multiple times with different parameters.

### Comparing Next.jdbc with clojure.java.jdbc

To appreciate the improvements `next.jdbc` offers, let's compare it with `clojure.java.jdbc` using a simple example.

#### Inserting a Record with clojure.java.jdbc

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as old-jdbc])

(old-jdbc/insert! db-spec :users {:name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com"})
```

#### Inserting a Record with Next.jdbc

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! datasource
               ["INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)" "Alice" "alice@example.com"])
```

**Comparison**:
- `next.jdbc` uses a more explicit and flexible approach with parameterized queries, while `clojure.java.jdbc` relies on maps for data insertion.
- `next.jdbc` provides better performance and security through prepared statements.

### Visualizing the Data Flow

To better understand how data flows through `next.jdbc`, let's visualize the process using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client Code] --> B[Datasource]
    B --> C[Database]
    A --> D[Execute SQL]
    D --> C
    C --> E[Result Set]
    E --> A
```

**Diagram Explanation**: 
- The client code interacts with the datasource to execute SQL queries.
- The datasource manages connections to the database.
- Results are returned to the client code for further processing.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of `next.jdbc`, try modifying the examples provided:

- Change the database type and connection parameters to connect to a different database, such as MySQL or SQLite.
- Experiment with different SQL queries, such as complex joins or aggregations.
- Use transactions to perform a series of operations that must succeed or fail together.
