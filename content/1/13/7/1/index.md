## 13.7.1 Using clojure.java.jdbc

In this section, we delve into the powerful `clojure.java.jdbc` library, a key tool for interacting with relational databases in Clojure. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database operations. `clojure.java.jdbc` builds on this foundation, offering a more idiomatic and functional approach to database interactions in Clojure.

### Introduction to clojure.java.jdbc

`clojure.java.jdbc` is a Clojure library that provides a simple and idiomatic way to interact with SQL databases. It abstracts the complexities of JDBC, allowing you to focus on writing clean and concise Clojure code for database operations. This library is particularly useful for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, managing transactions, and executing SQL queries.

#### Key Features of clojure.java.jdbc

- **Simplicity**: Provides a straightforward API for database operations.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
- **Functional Approach**: Encourages the use of Clojure's functional programming paradigms.
- **Transaction Management**: Simplifies handling of transactions with built-in support.

### Setting Up clojure.java.jdbc

Before we dive into code examples, let's set up `clojure.java.jdbc` in your Clojure project. You'll need to add the library as a dependency in your `project.clj` file if you're using Leiningen:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
                 [mysql/mysql-connector-java "8.0.26"]])
```

For tools.deps, add the following to your `deps.edn`:

```clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        org.clojure/java.jdbc {:mvn/version "0.7.12"}
        mysql/mysql-connector-java {:mvn/version "8.0.26"}}}
```

### Establishing a Database Connection

To interact with a database, you first need to establish a connection. `clojure.java.jdbc` uses a map to define the connection parameters. Here's an example of connecting to a MySQL database:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:dbtype "mysql"
   :dbname "my_database"
   :host "localhost"
   :user "root"
   :password "password"})

;; Establish a connection
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (println "Connected to the database!"))
```

**Explanation**: The `db-spec` map contains the database type, name, host, user, and password. The `with-db-connection` macro ensures that the connection is properly managed and closed after use.

### Executing SQL Queries

Once connected, you can execute SQL queries using `clojure.java.jdbc`. Let's start with a simple SELECT query:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/query conn ["SELECT * FROM users"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `query` function takes a connection and a vector containing the SQL query. It returns a sequence of maps, where each map represents a row from the result set.

### CRUD Operations

#### Create

To insert data into a table, use the `insert!` function:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/insert! conn :users {:name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com"}))
```

**Explanation**: The `insert!` function takes a connection, the table name (as a keyword), and a map of column-value pairs to insert.

#### Read

Reading data is done using the `query` function, as shown earlier. You can also use SQL parameters to filter results:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/query conn ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?" "Alice"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `?` is a placeholder for SQL parameters, which are provided as additional arguments.

#### Update

To update existing records, use the `update!` function:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/update! conn :users {:email "alice@newdomain.com"} ["name = ?" "Alice"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `update!` function takes a connection, the table name, a map of column-value pairs to update, and a vector specifying the WHERE clause.

#### Delete

Deleting records is done with the `delete!` function:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-connection [conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/delete! conn :users ["name = ?" "Alice"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `delete!` function takes a connection, the table name, and a vector specifying the WHERE clause.

### Handling Transactions

Transactions are crucial for ensuring data integrity. `clojure.java.jdbc` provides the `with-db-transaction` macro for managing transactions:

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-transaction [t-conn db-spec]
  (jdbc/insert! t-conn :users {:name "Bob" :email "bob@example.com"})
  (jdbc/update! t-conn :users {:email "bob@newdomain.com"} ["name = ?" "Bob"]))
```

**Explanation**: The `with-db-transaction` macro ensures that all operations within its body are executed within a single transaction. If any operation fails, the transaction is rolled back.

### Comparing with Java JDBC

In Java, database operations typically involve boilerplate code for managing connections, statements, and result sets. Here's a simple Java example for comparison:

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;

public class DatabaseExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database";
        String user = "root";
        String password = "password";

        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
            PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM users");
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();

            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("User: " + rs.getString("name"));
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

**Comparison**: Notice the verbosity in Java with explicit connection management and result set handling. In contrast, `clojure.java.jdbc` abstracts these details, allowing for more concise and readable code.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the examples above:

- **Add a new column** to the `users` table and update the `insert!` and `update!` operations to include this column.
- **Implement a transaction** that inserts multiple users and rolls back if any insertion fails.
- **Experiment with different SQL databases** by changing the `db-spec` map.

### Diagram: Data Flow in CRUD Operations
