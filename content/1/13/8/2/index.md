## 13.8.2 Deployment Options

Deploying a Clojure web application involves several strategies, each with its own set of advantages and trade-offs. As experienced Java developers, you may be familiar with deploying Java applications on various platforms. This section will guide you through deploying Clojure applications, leveraging your existing knowledge while highlighting Clojure-specific considerations.

### Standalone Server Deployment

Standalone server deployment involves packaging your Clojure application with an embedded server, such as Jetty or http-kit, and running it as a standalone process. This approach is straightforward and provides full control over the server environment.

#### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Easy to set up and manage, especially for small to medium-sized applications.
- **Control**: Full control over server configuration and lifecycle.
- **Portability**: Can be easily moved across environments without dependency on external servers.

#### Disadvantages

- **Scalability**: May require additional effort to scale, as each instance runs independently.
- **Maintenance**: Responsibility for server maintenance and updates.

#### Example: Deploying with Jetty

Here's a simple example of deploying a Clojure application using Jetty:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]))

(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})

(defn -main [& args]
  (run-jetty (wrap-defaults handler site-defaults) {:port 3000}))
```

In this example, we define a basic Ring handler and use Jetty to serve it. The `-main` function starts the server on port 3000.

### Deployment to Application Servers

Deploying to application servers like Jetty or Tomcat is a common approach for Java applications and is equally applicable to Clojure. This method involves packaging your application as a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.

#### Advantages

- **Familiarity**: Leverages existing Java application server infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Application servers often provide built-in support for clustering and load balancing.
- **Security**: Benefit from the security features of mature application servers.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of application server configuration and management.
- **Overhead**: May introduce additional overhead compared to standalone deployment.

#### Example: Deploying to Tomcat

To deploy a Clojure application to Tomcat, you need to package it as a WAR file. Here's a basic setup using Leiningen:

1. Add the `lein-ring` plugin to your `project.clj`:

   ```clojure
   :plugins [[lein-ring "0.12.5"]]
   ```

2. Define the Ring handler and WAR configuration:

   ```clojure
   :ring {:handler myapp.core/handler
          :war {:name "myapp.war"}}
   ```

3. Build the WAR file:

   ```bash
   lein ring uberwar
   ```

4. Deploy the generated `myapp.war` file to Tomcat.

### Containerization with Docker

Docker containerization encapsulates your application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistent behavior across environments. This approach is increasingly popular for its flexibility and ease of deployment.

#### Advantages

- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Isolation**: Isolates application dependencies, reducing conflicts.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications by deploying multiple containers.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of Docker and container orchestration.
- **Resource Overhead**: Containers introduce additional resource overhead.

#### Example: Dockerizing a Clojure Application

Here's a Dockerfile example for a Clojure application:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Clojure image as a base
FROM clojure:openjdk-11-lein

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the project files
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN lein uberjar

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/myapp-standalone.jar"]
```

To build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t myapp .
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp
```

### Cloud Platforms

Cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk offer managed environments for deploying applications, abstracting away much of the infrastructure management.

#### Advantages

- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies deployment and scaling with managed services.
- **Integration**: Offers integration with other cloud services (e.g., databases, caching).
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales applications based on demand.

#### Disadvantages

- **Cost**: Managed services can be more expensive than self-hosted solutions.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Ties your application to a specific cloud provider's ecosystem.

#### Example: Deploying to Heroku

Deploying a Clojure application to Heroku involves creating a Procfile and using Git for deployment:

1. Create a `Procfile` with the following content:

   ```
   web: java -jar target/myapp-standalone.jar
   ```

2. Deploy to Heroku using Git:

   ```bash
   git init
   heroku create
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push heroku master
   ```

### Guidelines for Selecting a Deployment Strategy

Choosing the right deployment strategy depends on several factors, including application complexity, scalability requirements, and team expertise. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

- **For Small Applications**: Consider standalone server deployment for simplicity and control.
- **For Enterprise Applications**: Use application servers to leverage existing infrastructure and scalability features.
- **For Modern Applications**: Opt for Docker containerization to ensure consistency and ease of scaling.
- **For Rapid Deployment**: Use cloud platforms like Heroku for quick deployment and scaling without managing infrastructure.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

Deploying Clojure web applications offers a range of options, each suited to different needs and environments. By understanding the advantages and trade-offs of each approach, you can select the most appropriate strategy for your application. Whether you choose standalone deployment, application servers, Docker, or cloud platforms, Clojure's flexibility and interoperability with Java make it a powerful choice for web development.

### Exercises

1. **Deploy a Simple Clojure Application**: Try deploying a basic "Hello, World!" application using each of the deployment methods discussed. Compare the ease of setup and performance.

2. **Dockerize an Existing Java Application**: If you have a Java application, try containerizing it with Docker and compare the process with Dockerizing a Clojure application.

3. **Explore Cloud Deployment**: Deploy a Clojure application to both Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Compare the deployment process and the features offered by each platform.

4. **Experiment with Scalability**: Set up a simple load test for your deployed application and observe how each deployment strategy handles increased traffic.

### Try It Yourself

- Modify the Dockerfile to use a different base image, such as `openjdk:11-jre-slim`, and observe the impact on the image size and build time.
- Experiment with different cloud providers, such as Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure, to deploy your Clojure application and compare the services offered.
