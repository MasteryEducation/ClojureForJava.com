## 9.1.2 Leveraging `when` and `when-not`

As Java developers venture into the world of Clojure, understanding the nuances of conditional logic in a functional programming paradigm becomes essential. Clojure offers powerful constructs like `when` and `when-not` that simplify and enhance the readability of conditional expressions. These constructs are particularly useful when you need to evaluate multiple expressions based on a single condition, without the need for an "else" part. In this section, we will delve into the syntax, usage, and best practices of `when` and `when-not`, providing a comprehensive guide for Java developers transitioning to Clojure.

### Understanding `when` in Clojure

The `when` construct in Clojure is a streamlined alternative to the `if` expression, designed for scenarios where you only need to execute a block of code if a condition is true, without requiring an alternative path. This makes `when` an ideal choice for simplifying code and enhancing readability.

#### Syntax of `when`

The syntax of `when` is straightforward:

```clojure
(when condition
  expr1
  expr2
  ...)
```

Here, `condition` is the predicate that determines whether the subsequent expressions (`expr1`, `expr2`, etc.) are evaluated. If the condition is true, all the expressions are executed in sequence. If the condition is false, none of the expressions are evaluated.

#### Example: Using `when` for Multiple Expressions

Consider a scenario where you want to log a message and update a counter only if a certain condition is met. Using `when`, you can achieve this concisely:

```clojure
(defn process-data [data]
  (when (valid-data? data)
    (println "Processing data...")
    (update-counter data)
    (save-to-database data)))
```

In this example, the `when` construct checks if `data` is valid using the `valid-data?` predicate. If the data is valid, it proceeds to print a message, update a counter, and save the data to a database. This eliminates the need for nested `if` statements and improves code clarity.

### Introducing `when-not`

While `when` executes expressions when a condition is true, `when-not` is its logical complement, executing expressions when a condition is false. This can be particularly useful for handling error cases or default actions when a condition is not met.

#### Syntax of `when-not`

The syntax of `when-not` mirrors that of `when`:

```clojure
(when-not condition
  expr1
  expr2
  ...)
```

Here, the expressions are evaluated only if the condition is false.

#### Example: Using `when-not` for Error Handling

Suppose you want to log an error and notify a user if a file is not found. Using `when-not`, you can handle this elegantly:

```clojure
(defn read-file [file-path]
  (when-not (file-exists? file-path)
    (println "Error: File not found.")
    (notify-user "The file you requested does not exist.")))
```

In this example, `when-not` checks if the file exists. If it does not, it logs an error message and notifies the user. This approach keeps the code clean and focused on the negative condition handling.

### Practical Applications and Best Practices

#### Simplifying Conditional Logic

Both `when` and `when-not` are excellent tools for simplifying conditional logic, especially when dealing with multiple expressions. By reducing the need for nested `if` statements, these constructs help maintain a flat and readable code structure.

#### Avoiding Side Effects

When using `when` and `when-not`, it's important to be mindful of side effects. Since these constructs are typically used for executing multiple expressions, ensure that the expressions do not unintentionally modify state or produce unexpected results.

#### Combining with Other Constructs

`when` and `when-not` can be combined with other Clojure constructs to create more complex logic flows. For instance, you can use them in conjunction with `let` bindings to introduce local variables within the conditional block:

```clojure
(defn process-order [order]
  (when (order-valid? order)
    (let [total (calculate-total order)
          discount (apply-discount total)]
      (println "Order processed with total:" discount)
      (update-inventory order))))
```

In this example, `let` is used to bind `total` and `discount` within the `when` block, allowing for more complex calculations and operations.

### Performance Considerations

While `when` and `when-not` offer syntactic simplicity, it's important to consider performance implications, especially in performance-critical applications. Ensure that the condition checks and expressions within these constructs are optimized for efficiency.

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Misunderstanding Evaluation**: Remember that `when` and `when-not` evaluate all expressions if the condition is met (or not met, in the case of `when-not`). Ensure that expressions are side-effect-free or intended to be executed.

2. **Overusing `when-not`**: While `when-not` is useful, overusing it can lead to less readable code. Consider whether `when` with a negated condition might be clearer.

3. **Ignoring Return Values**: Unlike `if`, which can return different values based on conditions, `when` and `when-not` are primarily used for side effects. Be cautious when relying on their return values.

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### Nested `when` and `when-not`

In some cases, you may need to nest `when` and `when-not` constructs to handle complex logic. While this is possible, it's generally advisable to refactor such logic into separate functions to maintain readability.

#### Using `when` in Conjunction with `doseq`

For iterating over collections with conditional logic, `when` can be combined with `doseq`:

```clojure
(doseq [item items]
  (when (condition? item)
    (process-item item)))
```

This pattern allows for efficient processing of items that meet a specific condition.

### Conclusion

The `when` and `when-not` constructs in Clojure provide a powerful and concise way to handle conditional logic, especially when multiple expressions need to be evaluated. By understanding their syntax, usage, and best practices, Java developers can effectively leverage these constructs to write clean and efficient Clojure code. As you continue to explore Clojure, consider how these constructs can simplify your code and enhance its readability.
