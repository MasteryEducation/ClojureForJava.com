## 9.1.1 Using `if` and `if-not`

In the realm of programming, decision-making is a fundamental concept that allows developers to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. For Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding conditional expressions is crucial. Clojure, being a functional language, offers a concise and expressive way to handle conditions using the `if` and `if-not` constructs. This section will delve into these constructs, providing a comprehensive understanding of their syntax, usage, and best practices.

### Understanding the `if` Expression

The `if` expression in Clojure is the primary conditional construct used to evaluate a condition and execute code based on whether the condition is true or false. The syntax of the `if` expression is straightforward:

```clojure
(if condition
  then-expr
  else-expr)
```

- **condition**: This is the expression that is evaluated to determine which branch to execute. If the condition evaluates to a truthy value (anything other than `nil` or `false`), the `then-expr` is executed.
- **then-expr**: This is the expression that is executed if the condition is true.
- **else-expr**: This is the expression that is executed if the condition is false. Importantly, the `else-expr` is optional, allowing for concise expressions when no action is needed for the false case.

#### Example with `else-expr`

Consider a scenario where we want to determine if a number is positive or not:

```clojure
(defn check-positive [n]
  (if (> n 0)
    "Positive"
    "Not Positive"))

(check-positive 5)  ; => "Positive"
(check-positive -3) ; => "Not Positive"
```

In this example, the condition ` (> n 0)` checks if the number `n` is greater than zero. If true, it returns "Positive"; otherwise, it returns "Not Positive".

#### Example without `else-expr`

In cases where no action is needed if the condition is false, the `else-expr` can be omitted:

```clojure
(defn print-positive [n]
  (if (> n 0)
    (println "Number is positive")))

(print-positive 5)  ; Prints "Number is positive"
(print-positive -3) ; Does nothing
```

Here, if the number is positive, it prints a message. If not, it simply does nothing.

### The `if-not` Expression

While `if` is the primary conditional construct, Clojure also provides `if-not`, which is a syntactic convenience for negating the condition:

```clojure
(if-not condition
  then-expr
  else-expr)
```

The `if-not` expression evaluates the `then-expr` if the condition is false, and the `else-expr` if the condition is true. This can sometimes make the code more readable by reducing the need for explicit negation.

#### Example of `if-not`

Let's rewrite the previous example using `if-not`:

```clojure
(defn check-non-positive [n]
  (if-not (> n 0)
    "Not Positive"
    "Positive"))

(check-non-positive 5)  ; => "Positive"
(check-non-positive -3) ; => "Not Positive"
```

In this example, `if-not` simplifies the logic by directly expressing the condition for the "Not Positive" case.

### Practical Applications and Best Practices

#### Conditional Logic in Real-World Applications

Conditional logic is pervasive in real-world applications. Whether it's determining user permissions, processing data based on input conditions, or controlling the flow of a game, `if` and `if-not` are indispensable tools.

Consider a simple user authentication check:

```clojure
(defn authenticate-user [user]
  (if (valid-user? user)
    (println "Access granted")
    (println "Access denied")))

(authenticate-user {:username "john" :password "secret"})
```

Here, `valid-user?` is a hypothetical function that checks the validity of a user. Based on its result, the appropriate access message is printed.

#### Best Practices for Using `if` and `if-not`

1. **Clarity Over Brevity**: While omitting the `else-expr` can make code shorter, always prioritize clarity. If the absence of an `else-expr` might confuse future readers, consider including it for explicitness.

2. **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Deeply nested `if` expressions can make code hard to read and maintain. Consider using `cond` or `case` for multiple conditions.

3. **Use `if-not` Judiciously**: While `if-not` can simplify negated conditions, overuse can lead to confusion. Always ensure that the logic remains clear and understandable.

4. **Leverage Truthiness**: Remember that in Clojure, only `nil` and `false` are considered falsey. This can be leveraged to simplify conditions, but be cautious of unintended truthy evaluations.

### Common Pitfalls and Optimization Tips

#### Pitfalls

- **Confusing `if` with `if-not`**: It's easy to mistakenly use `if-not` when `if` is intended, leading to inverted logic. Always double-check the condition and the intended logic.

- **Assuming `else-expr` is Mandatory**: Unlike some languages, Clojure's `if` does not require an `else-expr`. However, omitting it when necessary can lead to unexpected `nil` returns.

#### Optimization Tips

- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Clojure's `if` expressions are short-circuited, meaning the `else-expr` is not evaluated if the condition is true. This can be leveraged for performance optimizations, especially when the `else-expr` involves expensive computations.

- **Use `when` for Side Effects**: When only the `then-expr` is needed, and it involves side effects, consider using `when` for clarity and conciseness:

  ```clojure
  (when (> n 0)
    (println "Number is positive"))
  ```

### Advanced Usage and Considerations

#### Combining with Other Constructs

Clojure's `if` and `if-not` can be combined with other constructs like `let`, `do`, and `cond` for more complex logic:

```clojure
(defn process-number [n]
  (let [result (if (> n 0)
                 (do
                   (println "Processing positive number")
                   (* n 2))
                 (do
                   (println "Processing non-positive number")
                   (/ n 2)))]
    (println "Result:" result)))
```

In this example, `do` is used to group multiple expressions within each branch of the `if`.

#### Integration with Java

For Java developers, understanding how Clojure's conditional logic integrates with Java code is essential. Clojure's seamless Java interoperability allows conditions to be evaluated using Java methods:

```clojure
(defn check-string [s]
  (if (.isEmpty s)
    "String is empty"
    "String is not empty"))

(check-string "")    ; => "String is empty"
(check-string "Hi")  ; => "String is not empty"
```

Here, the Java method `.isEmpty` is used within a Clojure `if` expression, demonstrating the power of Clojure's integration with Java.

### Conclusion

Mastering the `if` and `if-not` expressions in Clojure is a crucial step for Java developers transitioning to functional programming. These constructs provide a powerful and expressive way to handle conditional logic, enabling developers to write clear, concise, and efficient code. By understanding their syntax, usage, and best practices, developers can harness the full potential of Clojure's conditional expressions in their applications.
