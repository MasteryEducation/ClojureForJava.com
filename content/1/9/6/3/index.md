## 9.6.3 Examples of Metaprogramming

Metaprogramming in Clojure allows developers to write code that writes code, offering powerful tools for abstraction and code generation. In this section, we will explore practical examples of metaprogramming in Clojure, focusing on generating repetitive code, implementing aspect-oriented programming (AOP) features, and building domain-specific languages (DSLs). These examples will help you leverage Clojure's macro system to create more expressive and concise code.

### Generating Repetitive Code

One of the most common uses of metaprogramming is to eliminate repetitive code patterns. In Java, you might use reflection or code generation libraries to achieve similar results, but Clojure's macros provide a more integrated and seamless approach.

#### Example: Generating Getter and Setter Functions

Consider a scenario where you need to create getter and setter functions for a set of fields. In Java, this might involve writing boilerplate code for each field. In Clojure, we can use macros to automate this process.

```clojure
(defmacro def-getters-setters
  [type & fields]
  `(do
     ~@(map (fn [field]
              `(do
                 (defn ~(symbol (str "get-" field)) [~'obj]
                   (get ~'obj ~(keyword field)))
                 (defn ~(symbol (str "set-" field)) [~'obj ~'value]
                   (assoc ~'obj ~(keyword field) ~'value))))
            fields)))

(def-getters-setters Person :name :age :email)

;; Usage
(let [person {:name "Alice" :age 30 :email "alice@example.com"}]
  (println (get-name person))  ; Output: Alice
  (println (set-age person 31))) ; Output: {:name "Alice", :age 31, :email "alice@example.com"}
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `def-getters-setters` macro takes a type and a list of fields.
- It generates getter and setter functions for each field using `defn`.
- The `~@` syntax is used to splice the generated code into the surrounding `do` block.

**Try It Yourself:**  
Modify the macro to include a default value for each field if it is not present in the object.

### Implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming Features

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as logging or security, from the main business logic. In Clojure, you can use macros to implement AOP-like features.

#### Example: Logging Function Calls

Let's create a macro that logs function calls and their arguments.

```clojure
(defmacro with-logging
  [fn-name & args]
  `(let [result# (~fn-name ~@args)]
     (println "Calling" '~fn-name "with arguments:" ~@args)
     (println "Result:" result#)
     result#))

(defn add [x y]
  (+ x y))

;; Usage
(with-logging add 3 5)
;; Output:
;; Calling add with arguments: 3 5
;; Result: 8
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `with-logging` macro wraps a function call, logging the function name and arguments.
- The `~` and `~@` syntax is used to insert the function name and arguments into the generated code.
- The `result#` symbol is used to capture the function's result, ensuring it is logged and returned.

**Try It Yourself:**  
Extend the macro to log the execution time of the function call.

### Building Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)

DSLs allow you to create a language tailored to a specific problem domain, making your code more expressive and easier to understand. Clojure's macros are well-suited for building internal DSLs.

#### Example: A Simple Query DSL

Let's build a simple DSL for querying a collection of maps.

```clojure
(defmacro query
  [& clauses]
  `(fn [data]
     (filter
      (fn [item#]
        (and
         ~@(map (fn [[op field value]]
                  `(= (~op (get item# ~field)) ~value))
                (partition 3 clauses))))
      data)))

(def data
  [{:name "Alice" :age 30}
   {:name "Bob" :age 25}
   {:name "Charlie" :age 35}])

;; Usage
(def query-age-30 (query = :age 30))
(println (query-age-30 data)) ; Output: ({:name "Alice", :age 30})
```

**Explanation:**  
- The `query` macro generates a filtering function based on the provided clauses.
- Each clause is a triplet of an operator, a field, and a value.
- The macro constructs a filter predicate using these clauses.

**Try It Yourself:**  
Enhance the DSL to support more complex queries, such as combining conditions with `or`.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

To better understand how these examples work, let's visualize the flow of data and code transformation using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Diagram: Code Generation with Macros

```mermaid

    B --> C[Insert Code into Program]

```

*Caption:* This diagram illustrates the process of defining a macro, generating code, inserting it into the program, and executing it.

```

*Caption:* This sequence diagram shows how the `with-logging` macro intercepts a function call, logs it, and returns the result.
