## 9.4 Pattern Matching with `case`

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in many functional programming languages, allowing developers to perform operations based on the structure and content of data. In Clojure, pattern matching is not as extensive as in languages like Haskell or Scala, but it provides a simple and efficient mechanism for value-based dispatch through the `case` expression. This section delves into the `case` expression, its syntax, use cases, and best practices, especially for Java developers transitioning to Clojure.

### Understanding the `case` Expression

The `case` expression in Clojure is used for selecting a branch of code to execute based on the value of an expression. It is similar to the `switch` statement in Java but with some key differences and advantages.

#### Syntax of `case`

The basic syntax of the `case` expression is as follows:

```clojure
(case test-expr
  constant1 result-expr1
  constant2 result-expr2
  ...
  default-expr)
```

- **`test-expr`**: The expression whose value is compared against the constants.
- **`constant1`, `constant2`, ...**: The constants to compare against the `test-expr`.
- **`result-expr1`, `result-expr2`, ...`**: The expressions to evaluate if the corresponding constant matches the `test-expr`.
- **`default-expr`**: The expression to evaluate if none of the constants match. This is optional, but if omitted and no match is found, a `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

#### Example of `case` Usage

Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of `case`:

```clojure
(defn number-to-string [x]
  (case x
    1 "one"
    2 "two"
    3 "three"
    "other"))
```

In this example, the function `number-to-string` takes a number `x` and returns its string representation if it is 1, 2, or 3. For any other number, it returns "other".

### Efficiency of `case` vs. `cond`

One of the main advantages of using `case` over `cond` is efficiency. The `case` expression is optimized for constant-time dispatch because it uses a hash map internally to match the constants. This makes it significantly faster than `cond` when dealing with a large number of discrete values.

Consider the following comparison:

```clojure
;; Using cond
(defn number-to-string-cond [x]
  (cond
    (= x 1) "one"
    (= x 2) "two"
    (= x 3) "three"
    :else "other"))

;; Using case
(defn number-to-string-case [x]
  (case x
    1 "one"
    2 "two"
    3 "three"
    "other"))
```

In the `number-to-string-cond` function, each condition is checked sequentially, which can be inefficient for a large number of conditions. In contrast, `number-to-string-case` uses `case`, which is more efficient due to its constant-time dispatch.

### Limitations of `case`

While `case` is efficient, it has some limitations:

1. **Constants Only**: The `case` expression only works with compile-time constants. You cannot use variables or expressions that evaluate at runtime as keys.

2. **Exact Matches**: `case` requires exact matches. It does not support pattern matching with ranges or conditions like `cond` does.

3. **No Fallthrough**: Unlike Java's `switch`, there is no fallthrough behavior in `case`. Each match is independent.

### Practical Use Cases

The `case` expression is ideal for scenarios where you need to dispatch based on a fixed set of known values. Here are some common use cases:

#### Enum-like Dispatch

When you have a set of discrete values that represent different states or commands, `case` is a perfect fit. For example:

```clojure
(defn command-handler [command]
  (case command
    :start "Starting the process"
    :stop "Stopping the process"
    :pause "Pausing the process"
    "Unknown command"))
```

#### Configuration and Settings

For applications with configuration settings that map to specific behaviors, `case` can be used to handle these mappings efficiently:

```clojure
(defn config-value [key]
  (case key
    :timeout 3000
    :retries 5
    :log-level :info
    "default"))
```

### Best Practices for Using `case`

1. **Use for Known Values**: Reserve the use of `case` for situations where you have a fixed set of known values. This ensures you leverage its efficiency.

2. **Default Case**: Always provide a default case to handle unexpected values gracefully. This prevents runtime exceptions and makes your code more robust.

3. **Avoid Complex Logic**: Keep the logic within `case` simple. If you need complex conditions, consider using `cond` or other control structures.

4. **Readability**: Ensure that the use of `case` enhances the readability of your code. If the logic becomes too convoluted, refactor it for clarity.

### Advanced Example: HTTP Status Code Handling

Let's consider a more advanced example where `case` is used to handle HTTP status codes:

```clojure
(defn http-status-message [status-code]
  (case status-code
    200 "OK"
    201 "Created"
    204 "No Content"
    400 "Bad Request"
    401 "Unauthorized"
    403 "Forbidden"
    404 "Not Found"
    500 "Internal Server Error"
    "Unknown Status"))
```

In this example, the `http-status-message` function maps HTTP status codes to their corresponding messages. This is a typical use case where `case` shines due to its efficiency and simplicity.

### Comparing `case` with Java's `switch`

For Java developers, understanding the differences between Clojure's `case` and Java's `switch` is crucial:

- **Data Types**: Java's `switch` works with primitive data types, enums, and strings (since Java 7), whereas Clojure's `case` works with any data type as long as the values are constants.

- **Fallthrough**: Java's `switch` allows fallthrough behavior, which can lead to bugs if not handled carefully. Clojure's `case` does not have fallthrough, making it safer and more predictable.

- **Efficiency**: Both `switch` and `case` are efficient for handling a fixed set of values, but `case` is often more concise and expressive in Clojure.

### Optimization Tips

1. **Profile Your Code**: Use profiling tools to measure the performance impact of using `case` in your application. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize code paths.

2. **Refactor When Necessary**: If your `case` expression grows too large, consider refactoring it into smaller functions or using a different control structure.

3. **Leverage Clojure's REPL**: Use the REPL to experiment with `case` expressions and test their behavior interactively. This accelerates development and debugging.

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing Default Case**: Omitting the default case can lead to unexpected exceptions. Always include a default case to handle unforeseen values.

2. **Complex Conditions**: Avoid using `case` for complex conditions that require calculations or runtime evaluations. Use `cond` or other constructs instead.

3. **Misunderstanding Constants**: Ensure that the values used in `case` are compile-time constants. Using variables or expressions will result in errors.

### Conclusion

The `case` expression in Clojure is a powerful tool for value-based dispatch, offering efficiency and simplicity for handling fixed sets of known values. By understanding its syntax, limitations, and best practices, Java developers can effectively leverage `case` in their Clojure applications. Whether you're handling configuration settings, command dispatch, or HTTP status codes, `case` provides a concise and performant solution.
