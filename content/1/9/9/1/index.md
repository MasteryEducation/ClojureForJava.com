## 9.9.1 Creating Custom Control Structures

In this section, we will explore the power of Clojure macros to create custom control structures, such as a `repeat-until` loop or a timing macro that measures execution time. As experienced Java developers, you are familiar with control structures like loops and conditionals. Clojure offers a unique opportunity to extend the language by creating your own control structures using macros. This capability allows you to tailor the language to better fit your problem domain, leading to more expressive and concise code.

### Understanding Macros in Clojure

Macros in Clojure are a powerful tool that allows you to transform code before it is evaluated. They enable you to create new syntactic constructs in a way that is not possible with functions alone. Macros operate on the code itself, allowing you to manipulate and generate code dynamically.

#### Key Differences Between Macros and Functions

- **Functions**: Evaluate their arguments before execution.
- **Macros**: Operate on unevaluated code, allowing you to control the evaluation process.

### Creating a `repeat-until` Loop

Let's start by creating a custom control structure: a `repeat-until` loop. This loop will repeatedly execute a block of code until a specified condition is met, similar to a `do-while` loop in Java.

#### Defining the Macro

```clojure
(defmacro repeat-until [condition & body]
  `(loop []
     (when-not ~condition
       ~@body
       (recur))))
```

- **`defmacro`**: Defines a macro.
- **`loop`**: Creates a loop construct.
- **`when-not`**: Executes the body if the condition is false.
- **`recur`**: Recursively calls the loop.

#### Using the `repeat-until` Macro

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))

(repeat-until (> @counter 5)
  (println "Counter:" @counter)
  (swap! counter inc))
```

- **`atom`**: A mutable reference type in Clojure.
- **`swap!`**: Atomically updates the value of an atom.

**Try It Yourself**: Modify the condition to stop the loop at a different value or change the body to perform different actions.

### Creating a Timing Macro

Next, we'll create a macro to measure the execution time of a block of code. This is useful for performance analysis and optimization.

#### Defining the Timing Macro

```clojure
(defmacro time-it [& body]
  `(let [start# (System/nanoTime)
         result# (do ~@body)
         end# (System/nanoTime)]
     (println "Execution time:" (/ (- end# start#) 1e6) "ms")
     result#))
```

- **`let`**: Binds variables to values.
- **`System/nanoTime`**: Retrieves the current time in nanoseconds.
- **`do`**: Executes a series of expressions and returns the result of the last one.

#### Using the Timing Macro

```clojure
(time-it
  (Thread/sleep 1000)
  (println "Finished sleeping"))
```

- **`Thread/sleep`**: Pauses execution for a specified number of milliseconds.

**Try It Yourself**: Measure the execution time of different code blocks or compare the performance of different algorithms.

### Comparing with Java

In Java, creating custom control structures is not as straightforward. You would typically use methods or classes to encapsulate behavior, but you cannot extend the language syntax itself. Clojure's macros provide a level of flexibility and expressiveness that is not available in Java.

#### Java Example: Timing Code Execution

```java
long startTime = System.nanoTime();
// Code block to measure
Thread.sleep(1000);
long endTime = System.nanoTime();
System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) / 1e6 + " ms");
```

- **Manual Timing**: Requires explicit start and end time capture.

### Advanced Macro Techniques

#### Quoting and Unquoting

Understanding quoting and unquoting is essential for writing macros. Quoting prevents evaluation, while unquoting allows selective evaluation within quoted expressions.

```clojure
(defmacro example-macro [x]
  `(println "Value of x:" ~x))
```

- **Backtick (`)**: Quotes the entire expression.
- **Tilde (~)**: Unquotes a specific part of the expression.

#### Macro Hygiene

Macro hygiene refers to avoiding unintended variable capture. Clojure provides mechanisms to ensure that variables introduced by macros do not interfere with user code.

```clojure
(defmacro hygienic-macro [x]
  (let [y# 10] ; Unique symbol
    `(println "Sum:" (+ ~x y#))))
```

- **Unique Symbols**: Generated using `#` to prevent clashes.

### Practical Examples and Exercises

1. **Exercise**: Create a macro that logs the start and end of a function execution.
2. **Challenge**: Implement a `try-catch-finally` macro for error handling.
3. **Experiment**: Modify the `repeat-until` macro to include an optional delay between iterations.

### Key Takeaways

- **Macros**: Enable the creation of custom control structures and language extensions.
- **Flexibility**: Clojure macros provide capabilities beyond what is possible in Java.
- **Hygiene**: Ensures that macros do not unintentionally capture variables.

### Summary

Creating custom control structures in Clojure using macros allows you to extend the language in powerful ways. By understanding the principles of macros, quoting, and hygiene, you can write expressive and efficient code tailored to your specific needs. Now that we've explored how to build custom control structures, let's apply these concepts to enhance your Clojure applications.

### What is a key difference between macros and functions in Clojure?

- [x] Macros operate on unevaluated code.
- [ ] Functions operate on unevaluated code.
- [ ] Macros evaluate their arguments before execution.
- [ ] Functions transform code before it is evaluated.
