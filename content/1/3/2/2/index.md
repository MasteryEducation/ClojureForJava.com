## 3.2.2 Strings

In this section, we will delve into the world of strings in Clojure, a fundamental data type that is essential for text manipulation and processing. As experienced Java developers, you are already familiar with the concept of strings, but Clojure offers a unique approach that leverages its functional programming paradigm. Let's explore how Clojure handles strings, the functions available for string manipulation, and how these concepts compare to Java.

### Creating Strings in Clojure

In Clojure, strings are created using double quotes, similar to Java. Strings in Clojure are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed. This immutability is a core principle of functional programming and offers several advantages, such as thread safety and ease of reasoning about code.

#### Example: Creating Strings

```clojure
(def greeting "Hello, World!") ; Define a string using double quotes
(def name "Clojure") ; Another string definition
```

In the above example, we define two strings, `greeting` and `name`, using double quotes. This is analogous to how strings are defined in Java:

```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
String name = "Java";
```

### Common String Functions

Clojure provides a rich set of functions for string manipulation. Let's explore some of the most commonly used functions: `str`, `format`, and `subs`.

#### The `str` Function

The `str` function is used to concatenate strings and other data types. It converts its arguments to strings and concatenates them.

```clojure
(def full-greeting (str greeting ", " name "!")) ; Concatenate strings
(println full-greeting) ; Output: Hello, World!, Clojure!
```

In Java, string concatenation is typically done using the `+` operator or the `StringBuilder` class for more complex operations:

```java
String fullGreeting = greeting + ", " + name + "!";
System.out.println(fullGreeting); // Output: Hello, World!, Java!
```

#### The `format` Function

The `format` function in Clojure is similar to `String.format` in Java. It allows you to create formatted strings using placeholders.

```clojure
(def formatted-greeting (format "Hello, %s! Welcome to %s." name "Clojure"))
(println formatted-greeting) ; Output: Hello, Clojure! Welcome to Clojure.
```

Java equivalent:

```java
String formattedGreeting = String.format("Hello, %s! Welcome to %s.", name, "Java");
System.out.println(formattedGreeting); // Output: Hello, Java! Welcome to Java.
```

#### The `subs` Function

The `subs` function extracts a substring from a given string. It takes the string, a start index, and an optional end index.

```clojure
(def sub-greeting (subs greeting 0 5)) ; Extract "Hello"
(println sub-greeting) ; Output: Hello
```

In Java, you would use the `substring` method:

```java
String subGreeting = greeting.substring(0, 5);
System.out.println(subGreeting); // Output: Hello
```

### String Concatenation and Interpolation

String concatenation in Clojure is primarily done using the `str` function, as shown earlier. However, Clojure also supports string interpolation through the use of the `format` function and libraries like `clojure.string`.

#### Example: String Concatenation

```clojure
(def concatenated (str "Hello, " name "!"))
(println concatenated) ; Output: Hello, Clojure!
```

#### String Interpolation

While Clojure does not have built-in string interpolation like some other languages, you can achieve similar results using `format` or third-party libraries.

```clojure
(def interpolated (format "Hello, %s! Welcome to %s." name "Clojure"))
(println interpolated) ; Output: Hello, Clojure! Welcome to Clojure.
```

### Advanced String Manipulation

Clojure's `clojure.string` namespace provides additional functions for advanced string manipulation, such as splitting, joining, and replacing strings.

#### Splitting Strings

The `split` function divides a string into a sequence of substrings based on a regular expression.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as str])

(def words (str/split greeting #", "))
(println words) ; Output: ["Hello" "World!"]
```

Java equivalent using `String.split`:

```java
String[] words = greeting.split(", ");
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(words)); // Output: [Hello, World!]
```

#### Joining Strings

The `join` function concatenates a sequence of strings with a specified delimiter.

```clojure
(def joined (str/join ", " ["Hello" "Clojure"]))
(println joined) ; Output: Hello, Clojure
```

Java equivalent using `String.join`:

```java
String joined = String.join(", ", "Hello", "Java");
System.out.println(joined); // Output: Hello, Java
```

#### Replacing Substrings

The `replace` function substitutes parts of a string with another string.

```clojure
(def replaced (str/replace greeting "World" "Clojure"))
(println replaced) ; Output: Hello, Clojure!
```

Java equivalent using `String.replace`:

```java
String replaced = greeting.replace("World", "Java");
System.out.println(replaced); // Output: Hello, Java!
```

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the examples above. For instance, experiment with different string functions, or create a function that takes a name and returns a personalized greeting.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of data through string functions in Clojure:

    B --> C[Concatenated String];

    D --> E[Formatted String];
    A --> F[subs Function];
    F --> G[Substring];
```

### Key Takeaways

- **Immutability**: Strings in Clojure are immutable, promoting thread safety and functional programming principles.
- **Rich Functionality**: Clojure provides a variety of functions for string manipulation, similar to Java but with a functional twist.
- **String Interpolation**: Achieved through `format` and libraries, offering flexibility in creating dynamic strings.
- **Comparison with Java**: While similar in many ways, Clojure's approach to strings emphasizes immutability and functional programming.

### Exercises

1. **Create a Greeting Function**: Write a Clojure function that takes a name and returns a greeting message using `str` and `format`.
2. **String Manipulation**: Use `clojure.string` functions to transform a sentence into a list of words, reverse the list, and join them back into a sentence.
3. **Substring Extraction**: Write a function that extracts the domain from an email address using `subs`.
