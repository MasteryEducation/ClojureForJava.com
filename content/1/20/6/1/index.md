## 20.6.1 Authentication and Authorization

In the world of microservices, securing your applications is paramount. Authentication and authorization are two critical components that ensure only the right users have access to the right resources. In this section, we'll explore various strategies for implementing authentication and authorization in Clojure microservices, including JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), OAuth 2.0, and API keys. We'll also discuss how to maintain consistency across services, drawing parallels with Java where applicable.

### Understanding Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into implementation, let's clarify the concepts:

- **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It's about answering the question: "Who are you?"
- **Authorization** determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. It answers: "What can you do?"

In a microservices architecture, these processes can become complex due to the distributed nature of services. Each service might need to authenticate requests and enforce authorization policies.

### Strategies for Authentication

#### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JWTs are a popular choice for stateless authentication in microservices. They are compact, URL-safe tokens that contain claims about a user and are signed to ensure integrity.

**Advantages of JWTs:**

- **Stateless**: No need to store session information on the server.
- **Scalable**: Easily distributed across services.
- **Interoperable**: Language-agnostic and widely supported.

**JWT Structure:**

A JWT consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, encoded as Base64 strings and separated by dots.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Header] --> B[Payload];
    B --> C[Signature];
    D[JWT] --> A;
    D --> B;
    D --> C;
```

*Diagram: Structure of a JWT*

**Clojure Example:**

Let's see how to generate and verify JWTs in Clojure using the `buddy` library.

```clojure
(ns myapp.auth
  (:require [buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt]))

(def secret "my-secret-key")

;; Generate a JWT
(defn generate-token [user-id]
  (jwt/sign {:user-id user-id} secret))

;; Verify a JWT
(defn verify-token [token]
  (try
    (jwt/unsign token secret)
    (catch Exception e
      nil))) ; Return nil if verification fails
```

*Code Explanation:*

- **`generate-token`**: Creates a JWT with a user ID as a claim.
- **`verify-token`**: Verifies the token using the secret key.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Modify the `secret` key and observe how verification fails with an incorrect key.
- Add additional claims to the JWT payload and verify them.

#### OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a service. It's widely used for delegated access, such as logging in with Google or Facebook.

**OAuth 2.0 Flow:**

1. **Authorization Request**: The client requests authorization from the resource owner.
2. **Authorization Grant**: The resource owner provides an authorization grant.
3. **Access Token Request**: The client requests an access token using the grant.
4. **Access Token Response**: The authorization server issues an access token.
5. **Resource Access**: The client uses the access token to access protected resources.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ResourceOwner
    participant AuthServer
    participant ResourceServer

    Client->>ResourceOwner: Request Authorization
    ResourceOwner-->>Client: Authorization Grant
    Client->>AuthServer: Request Access Token
    AuthServer-->>Client: Access Token
    Client->>ResourceServer: Access Resource
    ResourceServer-->>Client: Resource Data
```

*Diagram: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow*

**Clojure Example:**

Using `clj-oauth2`, we can implement an OAuth 2.0 client.

```clojure
(ns myapp.oauth
  (:require [clj-oauth2.client :as oauth2]))

(def client-config
  {:client-id "your-client-id"
   :client-secret "your-client-secret"
   :authorize-uri "https://provider.com/oauth2/authorize"
   :access-token-uri "https://provider.com/oauth2/token"
   :redirect-uri "https://yourapp.com/callback"})

(defn get-authorization-url []
  (oauth2/authorization-url client-config))

(defn get-access-token [code]
  (oauth2/access-token client-config {:code code}))
```

*Code Explanation:*

- **`get-authorization-url`**: Generates the URL for user authorization.
- **`get-access-token`**: Exchanges the authorization code for an access token.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Change the `redirect-uri` and observe how it affects the flow.
- Implement token refresh logic for long-lived sessions.

#### API Keys

API keys are simple tokens that identify the calling program. They are often used for server-to-server communication.

**Advantages of API Keys:**

- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use.
- **Control**: Can be revoked or rotated without affecting users.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(ns myapp.api-keys)

(def valid-api-keys #{"key1" "key2" "key3"})

(defn authenticate-api-key [api-key]
  (contains? valid-api-keys api-key))
```

*Code Explanation:*

- **`valid-api-keys`**: A set of valid API keys.
- **`authenticate-api-key`**: Checks if the provided key is valid.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Add new keys to the `valid-api-keys` set and test authentication.
- Implement rate limiting based on API keys.

### Strategies for Authorization

Authorization in microservices can be complex due to the need for consistent policy enforcement across services. Here are some strategies:

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users. Users are then assigned roles, simplifying permission management.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(ns myapp.rbac)

(def roles
  {:admin #{:read :write :delete}
   :user #{:read}})

(defn has-permission? [role permission]
  (contains? (roles role) permission))
```

*Code Explanation:*

- **`roles`**: Maps roles to their permissions.
- **`has-permission?`**: Checks if a role has a specific permission.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Add a new role and permissions, then test access control.
- Implement a function to assign roles to users.

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC uses attributes (e.g., user, resource, environment) to determine access. It's more flexible than RBAC but also more complex.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(ns myapp.abac)

(defn has-access? [user resource action]
  (and (= (:role user) :admin)
       (= (:resource-type resource) :document)
       (= action :read)))
```

*Code Explanation:*

- **`has-access?`**: Determines access based on user role, resource type, and action.

**Try It Yourself:**

- Modify the attributes and observe how access decisions change.
- Implement additional attribute checks for more complex scenarios.

### Consistency Across Services

Ensuring consistent authentication and authorization across microservices is crucial. Here are some best practices:

- **Centralized Authentication**: Use a single authentication service to issue tokens.
- **Shared Authorization Policies**: Define policies centrally and enforce them across services.
- **Token Introspection**: Validate tokens at the gateway or service level to ensure they are still valid.

### Comparing with Java

Java developers might be familiar with frameworks like Spring Security for authentication and authorization. Clojure offers similar capabilities but with a functional twist.

**Java Example:**

```java
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .and()
            .formLogin();
    }
}
```

**Comparison:**

- **Declarative vs. Functional**: Java uses annotations and configuration classes, while Clojure leverages functions and data structures.
- **Flexibility**: Clojure's functional nature allows for more dynamic and flexible security policies.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Implement JWT Authentication**: Create a Clojure service that issues and verifies JWTs. Add claims for user roles and permissions.
2. **OAuth 2.0 Client**: Set up an OAuth 2.0 client in Clojure and authenticate with a third-party provider.
3. **API Key Management**: Develop a system for managing API keys, including generation, revocation, and usage tracking.
4. **RBAC System**: Implement a role-based access control system in Clojure. Assign roles to users and enforce permissions.
5. **ABAC Implementation**: Create an attribute-based access control system. Use user and resource attributes to make access decisions.

### Key Takeaways
