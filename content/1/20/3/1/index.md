## 20.3.1 Synchronous Communication

In the realm of microservices, communication between services is a critical aspect that can significantly impact the overall architecture and performance of an application. Synchronous communication is one of the primary methods used to facilitate this interaction. In this section, we will delve into the details of implementing synchronous communication between microservices using Clojure, focusing on protocols like HTTP/HTTPS and gRPC. We will also discuss when synchronous communication is appropriate and the trade-offs associated with its use.

### Understanding Synchronous Communication

Synchronous communication involves a direct, real-time interaction between services, where a request is sent from one service to another, and the sender waits for a response before proceeding. This model is akin to a phone call, where both parties are engaged in the conversation simultaneously.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Blocking Nature**: The calling service is blocked until a response is received.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Provides instant feedback, making it suitable for operations requiring immediate confirmation.
- **Tight Coupling**: Can lead to tighter coupling between services, as they depend on each other's availability.

### When to Use Synchronous Communication

Synchronous communication is ideal in scenarios where real-time data exchange is crucial, such as:
- **User Authentication**: Verifying user credentials in real-time.
- **Payment Processing**: Ensuring transactions are completed before proceeding.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetching data that must be current and accurate.

However, it's essential to weigh the benefits against potential drawbacks, such as increased latency and reduced fault tolerance.

### Implementing Synchronous Communication with HTTP/HTTPS

HTTP/HTTPS is the most common protocol for synchronous communication in microservices. It is widely supported, easy to implement, and integrates seamlessly with web technologies.

#### Setting Up a Basic HTTP Server in Clojure

Let's start by setting up a simple HTTP server using Clojure's popular web library, Ring, and Compojure for routing.

```clojure
(ns my-microservice.core
  (:require [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [compojure.core :refer [defroutes GET POST]]
            [compojure.route :as route]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/hello" [] "Hello, World!")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000}))
```

**Explanation**:
- **Ring Adapter**: We use `ring.adapter.jetty` to run the server.
- **Compojure Routes**: Define routes using `GET` and `POST`.
- **Main Function**: Starts the server on port 3000.

#### Making HTTP Requests in Clojure

To make HTTP requests, we can use the `clj-http` library, which provides a simple interface for making HTTP calls.

```clojure
(ns my-microservice.client
  (:require [clj-http.client :as client]))

(defn fetch-greeting []
  (let [response (client/get "http://localhost:3000/hello")]
    (println (:body response))))
```

**Explanation**:
- **clj-http**: A Clojure HTTP client library.
- **GET Request**: Fetches data from the `/hello` endpoint.
- **Response Handling**: Prints the response body.

### Implementing Synchronous Communication with gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, language-agnostic RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 for transport. It is suitable for scenarios requiring efficient, low-latency communication.

#### Setting Up gRPC in Clojure

To use gRPC in Clojure, we can leverage the `clojure-grpc` library, which provides tools for defining and consuming gRPC services.

1. **Define the Service in a .proto File**:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

2. **Generate Clojure Code**:

Use the `protoc` compiler to generate Clojure code from the `.proto` file.

3. **Implement the Service in Clojure**:

```clojure
(ns my-microservice.grpc-server
  (:require [clojure-grpc.core :as grpc]))

(defn say-hello [request]
  {:message (str "Hello, " (:name request) "!")})

(defn -main []
  (grpc/start-server {:port 50051
                      :services {:greeter {:say-hello say-hello}}}))
```

**Explanation**:
- **gRPC Server**: Starts a gRPC server on port 50051.
- **Service Implementation**: Defines the `say-hello` function to handle requests.

4. **Consume the gRPC Service**:

```clojure
(ns my-microservice.grpc-client
  (:require [clojure-grpc.client :as grpc]))

(defn -main []
  (let [client (grpc/connect "localhost" 50051)
        response (grpc/invoke client :greeter/say-hello {:name "Clojure"})]
    (println (:message response))))
```

**Explanation**:
- **gRPC Client**: Connects to the gRPC server.
- **Invoke Method**: Calls the `say-hello` method with a request.

### Trade-offs of Synchronous Communication

While synchronous communication offers simplicity and immediate feedback, it comes with trade-offs:

- **Latency**: Network delays can impact performance.
- **Scalability**: Blocking calls can limit scalability.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Service unavailability can cause failures.

### Comparing HTTP and gRPC

| Feature         | HTTP/HTTPS                          | gRPC                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Protocol**    | Text-based                          | Binary (HTTP/2)                           |
| **Performance** | Moderate                            | High                                      |
| **Tooling**     | Extensive                           | Growing                                   |
| **Use Cases**   | Web applications, REST APIs         | Microservices, low-latency communication  |

### Best Practices for Synchronous Communication

- **Timeouts**: Always set timeouts to prevent indefinite blocking.
- **Retries**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers to handle failures gracefully.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests evenly across services.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by:
- Modifying the HTTP server to handle different routes.
