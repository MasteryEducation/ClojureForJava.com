## 20.7.2 Orchestration with Kubernetes

As we delve into the world of microservices, one of the key challenges is managing the deployment, scaling, and operation of these services. Kubernetes, an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers, is a powerful tool for orchestrating microservices, including those written in Clojure. In this section, we'll explore how to leverage Kubernetes to manage Clojure microservices effectively.

### Understanding Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is a container orchestration platform that provides a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.

#### Key Concepts

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.
- **Nodes**: Machines (physical or virtual) that run your applications and are managed by Kubernetes.
- **Clusters**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
- **Deployments**: Define the desired state for your application, such as the number of replicas.
- **Services**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.
- **Ingress**: Manages external access to the services, typically HTTP.

### Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

Before deploying your Clojure microservices, you need a Kubernetes cluster. You can set up a local cluster using Minikube or use cloud providers like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

#### Minikube Setup

Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. It creates a virtual machine on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.

1. **Install Minikube**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
2. **Start Minikube**: Run `minikube start` to create a local Kubernetes cluster.
3. **Verify Installation**: Use `kubectl get nodes` to ensure your cluster is running.

### Deploying Clojure Microservices

Let's deploy a simple Clojure microservice to our Kubernetes cluster. We'll use a basic Clojure application packaged as a Docker container.

#### Dockerizing a Clojure Application

First, we need to containerize our Clojure application using Docker. Here's a simple Dockerfile for a Clojure application:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Clojure image as a parent image
FROM clojure:openjdk-11-tools-deps

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the application dependencies
RUN clojure -M:deps

# Run the application
CMD ["clojure", "-M:run"]
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t clojure-app .
```

#### Creating a Kubernetes Deployment

A Deployment in Kubernetes is responsible for managing a set of identical Pods. It ensures that the desired number of Pods are running and can update them in a controlled manner.

Here's a YAML file for a Kubernetes Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: clojure-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: clojure-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: clojure-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: clojure-app
        image: clojure-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Apply the Deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f clojure-app-deployment.yaml
```

#### Exposing the Application with a Service

To make your application accessible, you need to define a Service. A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

Here's a YAML file for a Kubernetes Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: clojure-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: clojure-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the Service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f clojure-app-service.yaml
```

#### Managing External Access with Ingress

Ingress in Kubernetes manages external access to services, typically HTTP. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

Here's a YAML file for a Kubernetes Ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: clojure-app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: clojure-app.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: clojure-app-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Apply the Ingress:

```bash
kubectl apply -f clojure-app-ingress.yaml
```

### Monitoring and Scaling

Kubernetes provides built-in tools for monitoring and scaling your applications. You can use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale the number of Pods in a deployment based on observed CPU utilization or other select metrics.

#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Here's how you can define a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: clojure-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: clojure-app-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

Apply the Autoscaler:

```bash
kubectl apply -f clojure-app-hpa.yaml
```

### Best Practices for Kubernetes Orchestration

- **Use Namespaces**: Organize your resources using namespaces to avoid conflicts and manage resources efficiently.
- **Resource Requests and Limits**: Define resource requests and limits for your containers to ensure fair resource allocation and avoid resource contention.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data.
- **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to control traffic flow between Pods.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the Kubernetes setup by modifying the number of replicas in the Deployment or changing the resource limits. Observe how Kubernetes handles these changes seamlessly.

### Summary

Kubernetes provides a powerful platform for orchestrating Clojure microservices, offering features like automated deployment, scaling, and management. By leveraging Kubernetes, you can ensure your applications are resilient, scalable, and easy to manage.
