## A.2.2 Collection Manipulation

In Clojure, collections are immutable and persistent, meaning that any operation on a collection returns a new collection rather than modifying the original. This immutability is a cornerstone of functional programming, offering benefits such as thread safety and easier reasoning about code. For Java developers, accustomed to mutable collections, this shift can be both challenging and liberating. In this section, we'll explore Clojure's collection manipulation functions, drawing parallels to Java where applicable, and providing examples to illustrate their use.

### Understanding Clojure Collections

Clojure provides several core collection types:

- **Lists**: Ordered collections, typically used for sequential access.
- **Vectors**: Indexed collections, offering fast random access.
- **Maps**: Key-value pairs, similar to Java's `HashMap`.
- **Sets**: Collections of unique elements, akin to Java's `HashSet`.

Each collection type has specific functions optimized for its structure, but many functions are polymorphic, meaning they can operate on multiple types of collections.

### Key Collection Manipulation Functions

Let's delve into some of the most commonly used functions for manipulating collections in Clojure.

#### `conj`

The `conj` function is used to add elements to a collection. Its behavior varies slightly depending on the collection type:

- **Lists**: Adds elements to the front.
- **Vectors**: Adds elements to the end.
- **Sets**: Adds elements if they are not already present.

```clojure
;; Adding to a list
(def my-list '(1 2 3))
(def new-list (conj my-list 0))
;; new-list => (0 1 2 3)

;; Adding to a vector
(def my-vector [1 2 3])
(def new-vector (conj my-vector 4))
;; new-vector => [1 2 3 4]

;; Adding to a set
(def my-set #{1 2 3})
(def new-set (conj my-set 4))
;; new-set => #{1 2 3 4}
```

In Java, adding elements to collections typically involves methods like `add` or `put`, which mutate the collection. In Clojure, `conj` returns a new collection, preserving immutability.

#### `assoc`

The `assoc` function is used to associate a key with a value in a map or to update an element at a specific index in a vector.

```clojure
;; Associating a key with a value in a map
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
(def new-map (assoc my-map :c 3))
;; new-map => {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}

;; Updating an element in a vector
(def my-vector [1 2 3])
(def updated-vector (assoc my-vector 1 10))
;; updated-vector => [1 10 3]
```

In Java, updating a map involves using `put`, which modifies the map in place. Clojure's `assoc` returns a new map with the updated key-value pair.

#### `dissoc`

The `dissoc` function removes a key from a map.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
(def smaller-map (dissoc my-map :b))
;; smaller-map => {:a 1, :c 3}
```

Java's `remove` method on maps is similar, but again, it mutates the original map, whereas `dissoc` returns a new map.

#### `update`

The `update` function applies a function to the value associated with a key in a map.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
(def updated-map (update my-map :b inc))
;; updated-map => {:a 1, :b 3}
```

This is akin to retrieving a value from a map, modifying it, and then putting it back, but `update` does this in a single, atomic operation.

#### `merge`

The `merge` function combines multiple maps into one.

```clojure
(def map1 {:a 1 :b 2})
(def map2 {:b 3 :c 4})
(def merged-map (merge map1 map2))
;; merged-map => {:a 1, :b 3, :c 4}
```

In Java, merging maps typically involves iterating over one map and inserting its entries into another. Clojure's `merge` simplifies this process.

#### `into`

The `into` function is used to add all elements from one collection into another.

```clojure
(def vector1 [1 2 3])
(def vector2 [4 5 6])
(def combined-vector (into vector1 vector2))
;; combined-vector => [1 2 3 4 5 6]
```

This is similar to Java's `addAll` method for collections, but `into` works with any Clojure collection type.

#### `get`

The `get` function retrieves the value associated with a key in a map or an index in a vector.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
(def value (get my-map :a))
;; value => 1

(def my-vector [10 20 30])
(def element (get my-vector 1))
;; element => 20
```

In Java, you would use `get` on a map or `get` on a list, but Clojure's `get` is polymorphic and works across different collection types.

#### `contains?`

The `contains?` function checks if a map contains a specific key or if a set contains a specific element.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
(def has-key (contains? my-map :a))
;; has-key => true

(def my-set #{1 2 3})
(def has-element (contains? my-set 2))
;; has-element => true
```

Java's `containsKey` and `contains` methods are similar, but `contains?` is more versatile.

#### `keys` and `vals`

The `keys` and `vals` functions return the keys and values of a map, respectively.

```clojure
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
(def map-keys (keys my-map))
;; map-keys => (:a :b :c)

(def map-vals (vals my-map))
;; map-vals => (1 2 3)
```

In Java, you would use `keySet` and `values` methods on a map to achieve similar results.

### Comparing Clojure and Java Collection Manipulation

Let's compare how some of these operations differ between Clojure and Java:

```java
// Java: Adding elements to a list
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
list.add(0, 0); // Modifies the list in place

// Clojure: Adding elements to a list
(def my-list '(1 2 3))
(def new-list (conj my-list 0)) ; Returns a new list
```

```java
// Java: Updating a map
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("a", 1);
map.put("b", 2);
map.put("c", 3); // Modifies the map in place

// Clojure: Updating a map
(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})
(def new-map (assoc my-map :c 3)) ; Returns a new map
```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code snippets to deepen your understanding of Clojure's collection manipulation functions:

1. **Modify `conj`**: Try adding multiple elements at once to a vector or list.
2. **Use `assoc` with vectors**: Update multiple indices in a vector.
3. **Combine maps with `merge`**: Merge more than two maps and observe the behavior when keys overlap.
4. **Explore `into`**: Use `into` to combine different types of collections, such as a set into a vector.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

Below is a diagram illustrating how `conj` behaves differently with lists and vectors:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original List: (1 2 3)] -->|conj 0| B[New List: (0 1 2 3)];
    C[Original Vector: [1 2 3]] -->|conj 4| D[New Vector: [1 2 3 4]];
```

*Diagram 1: The `conj` function adds elements to the front of a list and the end of a vector.*

### Exercises

1. **Create a Map Manipulation Function**: Write a function that takes a map and a key-value pair, updates the map with the pair, and removes a specified key.
2. **Vector Index Update**: Implement a function that updates multiple indices in a vector using `assoc`.
3. **Set Operations**: Create a function that takes two sets and returns a new set with elements that are only in the first set.

### Key Takeaways

- Clojure's collection manipulation functions are designed to work with immutable data structures, providing thread safety and functional purity.
- Functions like `conj`, `assoc`, and `merge` allow for expressive and concise manipulation of collections.
- Understanding these functions can help Java developers leverage Clojure's strengths in handling data immutably and functionally.

- [x] Adds elements to the front of the list
- [ ] Adds elements to the end of the list
- [ ] Removes elements from the list
- [ ] Replaces elements in the list

> **Explanation:** The `conj` function adds elements to the front of a list in Clojure, unlike vectors where it adds to the end.

### How does `assoc` differ when used with maps versus vectors?

- [x] Associates a key with a value in maps and updates an index in vectors
- [ ] Only works with maps
- [ ] Only works with vectors
- [ ] Removes keys from maps
