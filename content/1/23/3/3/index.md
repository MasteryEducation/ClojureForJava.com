## A.3.3 Maps

Maps are a fundamental data structure in Clojure, providing a way to associate keys with values. They are similar to Java's `HashMap` and `TreeMap`, but with a focus on immutability and functional programming principles. In this section, we'll explore Clojure's hash maps and sorted maps, their uses, and how to perform common operations such as creating maps, accessing and updating values, and leveraging keywords as map keys.

### Understanding Clojure Maps

Clojure maps are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. They are immutable, meaning that any operation that modifies a map returns a new map with the changes, leaving the original map unchanged. This immutability is a core feature of Clojure's functional programming paradigm, promoting safer and more predictable code.

#### Hash Maps

Hash maps in Clojure are the most common type of map, providing efficient key-value lookups. They are similar to Java's `HashMap`, but with the added benefit of immutability.

```clojure
;; Creating a hash map
(def my-map {:name "Alice" :age 30 :city "New York"})

;; Accessing values
(get my-map :name) ;=> "Alice"

;; Using keywords as functions
(:age my-map) ;=> 30

;; Checking for keys
(contains? my-map :city) ;=> true

;; Updating maps
(def updated-map (assoc my-map :age 31))
```

#### Sorted Maps

Sorted maps maintain their keys in a sorted order, similar to Java's `TreeMap`. They are useful when you need to iterate over keys in a specific order.

```clojure
;; Creating a sorted map
(def sorted-map (sorted-map :b 2 :a 1 :c 3))

;; Accessing values
(get sorted-map :a) ;=> 1

;; Iterating over keys
(keys sorted-map) ;=> (:a :b :c)
```

### Creating and Accessing Maps

Creating maps in Clojure is straightforward. You can use the literal syntax with curly braces or the `hash-map` function.

```clojure
;; Using literal syntax
(def my-map {:name "Bob" :age 25})

;; Using hash-map function
(def another-map (hash-map :country "USA" :language "English"))
```

Accessing values in a map can be done using the `get` function or by treating keywords as functions.

```clojure
;; Using get function
(get my-map :name) ;=> "Bob"

;; Using keywords as functions
(:age my-map) ;=> 25
```

### Updating Maps

Since Clojure maps are immutable, updating a map involves creating a new map with the desired changes. The `assoc`, `dissoc`, and `merge` functions are commonly used for this purpose.

#### Associating New Key-Value Pairs

The `assoc` function adds or updates key-value pairs in a map.

```clojure
;; Adding a new key-value pair
(def new-map (assoc my-map :email "bob@example.com"))

;; Updating an existing key-value pair
(def updated-map (assoc my-map :age 26))
```

#### Dissociating Keys

The `dissoc` function removes key-value pairs from a map.

```clojure
;; Removing a key-value pair
(def smaller-map (dissoc my-map :age))
```

#### Merging Maps

The `merge` function combines multiple maps into one, with later maps overriding earlier ones for duplicate keys.

```clojure
;; Merging maps
(def merged-map (merge my-map {:city "Los Angeles" :age 27}))
```

### Using Keywords as Map Keys

In Clojure, keywords are often used as map keys due to their efficiency and readability. Keywords can be used as functions to retrieve values from maps, providing a concise and expressive syntax.

```clojure
;; Using keywords as map keys
(def person {:first-name "Charlie" :last-name "Brown"})

;; Accessing values with keywords
(:first-name person) ;=> "Charlie"
```

### Immutability and Persistent Data Structures

Clojure's maps are part of its persistent data structures, which provide efficient immutable updates. When you update a map, Clojure creates a new map that shares structure with the original, minimizing memory usage and improving performance.

```mermaid

    A[Original Map] -->|assoc| B[Updated Map]
    A -->|dissoc| C[Reduced Map]
    A -->|merge| D[Merged Map]
```

### Comparing Clojure Maps with Java Maps

While both Clojure and Java provide map data structures, there are key differences:

- **Immutability**: Clojure maps are immutable by default, whereas Java's `HashMap` and `TreeMap` are mutable.
- **Syntax**: Clojure's syntax for creating and accessing maps is more concise, leveraging keywords as functions.
- **Concurrency**: Clojure's immutability simplifies concurrent programming, as maps can be safely shared between threads without synchronization.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code snippets to deepen your understanding of Clojure maps:

1. Create a map with your own key-value pairs and access values using both `get` and keywords.
2. Update the map by adding new keys and modifying existing ones using `assoc`.
3. Remove keys using `dissoc` and observe the changes.
4. Merge two maps and see how conflicts are resolved.

### Exercises

1. **Create a Map**: Define a map representing a book with keys like `:title`, `:author`, and `:year`. Access the values using both `get` and keywords.
2. **Update a Map**: Add a new key `:publisher` to the book map and update the `:year` key.
3. **Merge Maps**: Create another map with additional book details like `:genre` and `:pages`. Merge it with the original book map.
4. **Remove Keys**: Remove the `:year` key from the merged map and verify the result.

### Summary and Key Takeaways

- Clojure maps are immutable collections of key-value pairs, similar to Java's `HashMap` and `TreeMap`.
- Hash maps provide efficient lookups, while sorted maps maintain keys in order.
- Common operations include creating maps, accessing values, and updating maps using `assoc`, `dissoc`, and `merge`.
- Keywords are often used as map keys for their efficiency and readability.
- Immutability in Clojure maps simplifies concurrent programming and enhances code safety.

By mastering Clojure maps, you can effectively manage key-value associations in your applications, leveraging the power of immutability and functional programming.
