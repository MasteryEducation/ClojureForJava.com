## 21.2.2 Project Conventions and Guidelines

Contributing to open source projects is a rewarding endeavor that not only enhances your skills but also allows you to give back to the community. For Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding and adhering to project conventions and guidelines is crucial for successful contributions. This section will guide you through the key aspects of project conventions, coding standards, commit message conventions, and contribution guidelines in Clojure projects.

### Importance of Adhering to Project Conventions

Project conventions are the backbone of any successful open source project. They ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase. For Java developers, this might be akin to following Java's coding standards, such as those outlined in the [Java Code Conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html). In Clojure, these conventions might differ due to the language's functional nature and unique features.

#### Key Benefits of Following Conventions

- **Consistency**: Ensures that all contributors write code in a similar style, making it easier for others to read and understand.
- **Quality**: Adhering to coding standards often leads to higher quality code with fewer bugs.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates smoother collaboration among contributors by reducing misunderstandings and conflicts.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time during code reviews and merges by minimizing the need for style-related feedback.

### Finding and Interpreting Project Conventions

Most open source projects will have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or similar documentation that outlines the project's conventions and guidelines. This file is typically located in the root directory of the project's repository. Here's how you can find and interpret these documents:

1. **Locate the `CONTRIBUTING.md` File**: This file often contains detailed instructions on how to contribute, including coding standards, commit message guidelines, and the process for submitting pull requests.

2. **Read the `README.md`**: The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and often links to other important documents, including the contribution guidelines.

3. **Check for a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: This document outlines the expected behavior of contributors and is crucial for maintaining a respectful and inclusive community.

4. **Explore the Wiki**: Some projects maintain a wiki with additional documentation, including detailed coding standards and architectural guidelines.

5. **Review Past Pull Requests**: Examining merged pull requests can provide insights into the project's expectations and the types of contributions that are accepted.

### Coding Standards in Clojure Projects

Clojure projects often follow specific coding standards to maintain code quality and readability. These standards might include guidelines on naming conventions, indentation, and the use of specific language features. Let's explore some common coding standards in Clojure:

#### Naming Conventions

- **Functions and Variables**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-function`, `user-name`) for function and variable names. This is different from Java's camelCase convention.
- **Namespaces**: Typically use a reverse domain name notation (e.g., `com.example.myproject`), similar to Java package naming.

#### Indentation and Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use two spaces for indentation, which is a common practice in Clojure projects.
- **Line Length**: Aim to keep lines under 80 characters for better readability.
- **Parentheses**: Properly align parentheses to enhance code readability.

#### Example: Clojure Code Formatting

```clojure
(ns com.example.myproject.core)

(defn my-function
  "A simple example function."
  [x y]
  (+ x y)) ; Add x and y

;; Use kebab-case for function names
(defn calculate-sum
  [numbers]
  (reduce + numbers)) ; Sum a collection of numbers
```

#### Comparing with Java Code Formatting

In Java, you might write a similar function using camelCase and different indentation:

```java
public class MyProject {
    public static int calculateSum(List<Integer> numbers) {
        return numbers.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();
    }
}
```

### Commit Message Conventions

Commit messages are a vital part of the development process, providing context and history for changes made to the codebase. Many projects follow specific commit message conventions to ensure clarity and consistency.

#### Common Commit Message Guidelines

- **Use the Imperative Mood**: Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- **Keep the First Line Short**: Limit the first line to 50 characters or less, summarizing the change.
- **Provide Detailed Descriptions**: Use additional lines to provide more context if necessary, wrapping lines at 72 characters.

#### Example: Clojure Commit Message

```
Add new feature to calculate sum

This commit introduces a new function `calculate-sum` that sums a collection of numbers. It improves the performance by using `reduce` instead of a loop.
```

#### Comparing with Java Commit Message

In Java projects, the commit message conventions might be similar, but the focus might differ based on the project's needs:

```
Implement sum calculation feature

Added a new method `calculateSum` in `MyProject` class to sum a list of integers using Java Streams.
```

### Contribution Guidelines

Contribution guidelines provide a roadmap for new contributors, outlining the process for submitting changes and the expectations for contributions. These guidelines are crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive open source community.

#### Key Elements of Contribution Guidelines

- **Forking and Cloning**: Instructions on how to fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- **Branching Strategy**: Guidelines on creating branches for new features or bug fixes.
- **Testing Requirements**: Expectations for writing and running tests before submitting a pull request.
- **Code Review Process**: Information on how code reviews are conducted and what reviewers look for.

#### Example: Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, following the project's coding standards.
5. **Write Tests**: Ensure your changes are covered by tests.
6. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages.
7. **Push to GitHub**: Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
8. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request against the original repository.

### Understanding the Code Review Process

Code reviews are an integral part of the contribution process, ensuring that changes meet the project's standards and do not introduce new issues. Here's what to expect during a code review:

- **Feedback on Code Quality**: Reviewers will provide feedback on the quality and readability of your code.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: You may receive suggestions for improving your implementation or adhering more closely to the project's conventions.
- **Discussion and Iteration**: Be prepared to discuss your changes and iterate on your implementation based on feedback.

### Try It Yourself: Contributing to a Clojure Project

To practice contributing to a Clojure project, try the following exercise:

1. **Find a Clojure Project**: Search for a Clojure project on GitHub that interests you.
2. **Read the Contribution Guidelines**: Locate and read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
3. **Identify an Issue**: Look for an open issue labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted."
4. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Follow the project's instructions to fork and clone the repository.
5. **Implement a Solution**: Implement a solution for the issue, adhering to the project's conventions.
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request and engage with the maintainers during the review process.

### Exercises and Practice Problems

1. **Exercise 1**: Find a Clojure project on GitHub and identify the key elements of its contribution guidelines. Write a summary of these elements.
2. **Exercise 2**: Compare the coding standards of a Clojure project with those of a Java project you have worked on. Identify similarities and differences.
3. **Exercise 3**: Write a commit message for a hypothetical change in a Clojure project, following the commit message conventions outlined in this section.
