## 16.1.2 Concurrency vs. Parallelism

In the realm of software development, especially when transitioning from Java to Clojure, understanding the concepts of concurrency and parallelism is crucial. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct ideas that can significantly impact how we design and optimize our applications. In this section, we'll delve into these concepts, explore their differences, and see how they relate to asynchronous programming in Clojure.

### Understanding Concurrency

**Concurrency** is about dealing with lots of things at once. It's the ability of a program to manage multiple tasks simultaneously, but not necessarily executing them at the same time. Concurrency is more about the structure of the program and how it handles multiple tasks, allowing them to make progress without necessarily running in parallel.

In Java, concurrency is often managed using threads. A thread is a lightweight process that can run independently within a program. Java provides several mechanisms to handle concurrency, such as the `Thread` class, `Runnable` interface, and the `ExecutorService` framework.

#### Concurrency in Java

Here's a simple example of concurrency in Java using threads:

```java
public class ConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task1 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Task 1 - Count: " + i);
            }
        };

        Runnable task2 = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Task 2 - Count: " + i);
            }
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, two tasks are defined and run concurrently. The tasks are not necessarily executed simultaneously, but they are interleaved, allowing both to make progress.

#### Concurrency in Clojure

Clojure, being a functional language, approaches concurrency differently. It provides several concurrency primitives like **atoms**, **refs**, **agents**, and **futures** to manage state changes safely across threads.

Here's a simple example using Clojure's `future` to achieve concurrency:

```clojure
(defn task [name]
  (dotimes [i 5]
    (println (str name " - Count: " i))))

(def task1 (future (task "Task 1")))
(def task2 (future (task "Task 2")))

@task1
@task2
```

In this Clojure example, `future` is used to run tasks concurrently. The `@` symbol is used to dereference the future, ensuring that the main thread waits for the tasks to complete.

### Understanding Parallelism

**Parallelism** is about doing lots of things at once. It involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores. Parallelism is a subset of concurrency, where tasks are not only managed concurrently but are also executed in parallel.

#### Parallelism in Java

Java provides the `ForkJoinPool` and parallel streams to facilitate parallelism. Here's an example using Java's parallel streams:

```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream.range(0, 10).parallel().forEach(i -> {
            System.out.println("Processing: " + i);
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, the `parallel()` method is used to process elements in parallel, leveraging multiple CPU cores.

#### Parallelism in Clojure

Clojure's `pmap` function allows for parallel processing of collections. Here's an example:

```clojure
(defn process [n]
  (println (str "Processing: " n)))

(pmap process (range 10))
```

In this Clojure example, `pmap` is used to apply the `process` function to each element in the range in parallel.

### Concurrency vs. Parallelism: Key Differences

- **Concurrency** is about managing multiple tasks at once, while **parallelism** is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Concurrency can be achieved on a single-core processor, whereas parallelism requires multiple cores.
- Concurrency is more about the design and structure of the program, while parallelism is about execution.

### Asynchronous Programming and Concurrency

Asynchronous programming is a form of concurrency that allows a single thread to manage multiple tasks efficiently. It enables non-blocking operations, where tasks can be initiated and then completed at a later time, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks in the meantime.

#### Asynchronous Programming in Java

Java provides the `CompletableFuture` class for asynchronous programming:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class AsyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running async task");
        });

        future.join(); // Wait for the task to complete
    }
}
```

In this example, `CompletableFuture.runAsync` is used to run a task asynchronously.

#### Asynchronous Programming in Clojure

Clojure's `core.async` library provides channels and go blocks for asynchronous programming:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [go <! >! chan]])

(defn async-task [c]
  (go
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    (>! c "Task completed")))

(let [c (chan)]
  (async-task c)
  (println "Waiting for task...")
  (println (<! c)))
```

In this Clojure example, a channel `c` is created, and a task is run asynchronously using a `go` block. The main thread waits for the task to complete by reading from the channel.

### Diagrams and Visualizations

To better understand these concepts, let's visualize the flow of tasks in concurrency and parallelism.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Concurrency];
    B --> C[Task 1];
    B --> D[Task 2];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```

**Diagram 1: Concurrency Flow** - This diagram illustrates how tasks are managed concurrently, allowing them to progress without necessarily running in parallel.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Parallelism];
    B --> C[Task 1];
    B --> D[Task 2];
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```

**Diagram 2: Parallelism Flow** - This diagram shows tasks being executed simultaneously, leveraging multiple CPU cores.
