## 4.1 Pure Functions and Immutability

As experienced Java developers, you are likely accustomed to the object-oriented paradigm, where mutable state and side effects are common. Transitioning to Clojure, a functional programming language, requires a shift in mindset, particularly regarding pure functions and immutability. These concepts are foundational to writing reliable, maintainable, and scalable code in Clojure.

### Understanding Pure Functions

**Pure functions** are a cornerstone of functional programming. A function is considered pure if it satisfies two main criteria:

1. **Deterministic Output**: Given the same input, a pure function always produces the same output.
2. **No Side Effects**: A pure function does not alter any external state or interact with the outside world (e.g., modifying a global variable, writing to a file, or printing to the console).

#### Why Pure Functions Matter

Pure functions offer several advantages:

- **Predictability**: Since pure functions always produce the same output for the same input, they are easier to reason about and test.
- **Concurrency**: Pure functions can be executed in parallel without the risk of race conditions, as they do not rely on shared state.
- **Composability**: Pure functions can be composed together to build more complex operations, enhancing code modularity and reuse.

#### Pure Functions in Clojure

Let's explore how pure functions are implemented in Clojure with a simple example:

```clojure
;; Clojure example of a pure function
(defn add [x y]
  (+ x y))

;; Calling the function with the same inputs will always yield the same result
(println (add 2 3)) ; => 5
```

In this example, the `add` function is pure because it consistently returns the sum of `x` and `y` without altering any external state.

#### Java vs. Clojure: Pure Functions

In Java, achieving pure functions requires discipline, as the language does not enforce immutability or side-effect-free functions. Consider the following Java example:

```java
// Java example of a pure function
public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

// Calling the function with the same inputs will always yield the same result
System.out.println(MathUtils.add(2, 3)); // => 5
```

While the Java method `add` is pure, Java's mutable state and object-oriented nature often lead to side effects, making it challenging to maintain purity across larger systems.

### Emphasizing Immutability

**Immutability** is another key concept in functional programming. An immutable object is one whose state cannot be modified after it is created. In Clojure, immutability is the default, promoting safer and more predictable code.

#### Benefits of Immutability

- **Thread Safety**: Immutable data structures can be shared across threads without synchronization, reducing the complexity of concurrent programming.
- **Ease of Reasoning**: With immutable data, you can be confident that data will not change unexpectedly, simplifying debugging and reasoning about code.
- **Historical State**: Immutability allows you to maintain historical versions of data, enabling features like undo functionality.

#### Immutability in Clojure

Clojure provides a rich set of immutable data structures, such as lists, vectors, maps, and sets. Let's examine how immutability works in Clojure:

```clojure
;; Clojure example of immutable data structures
(def my-vector [1 2 3])

;; Attempting to "modify" the vector returns a new vector
(def new-vector (conj my-vector 4))

(println my-vector)  ; => [1 2 3]
(println new-vector) ; => [1 2 3 4]
```

In this example, `my-vector` remains unchanged after the `conj` operation, demonstrating Clojure's commitment to immutability.

#### Java vs. Clojure: Immutability

In Java, immutability is not the default, but it can be achieved using final classes and fields. Consider the following Java example:

```java
// Java example of an immutable class
public final class ImmutablePoint {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }

    public int getY() {
        return y;
    }
}

// ImmutablePoint instances cannot be modified after creation
ImmutablePoint point = new ImmutablePoint(1, 2);
```

While Java can achieve immutability, it requires explicit design choices, whereas Clojure's immutability is inherent and pervasive.

### Combining Pure Functions and Immutability

The combination of pure functions and immutability leads to code that is easier to test, debug, and maintain. Let's explore a practical example that combines these concepts:

```clojure
;; Clojure example combining pure functions and immutability
(defn calculate-discount [price discount-rate]
  (* price (- 1 discount-rate)))

(defn apply-discounts [prices discount-rate]
  (map #(calculate-discount % discount-rate) prices))

(def prices [100 200 300])
(def discounted-prices (apply-discounts prices 0.1))

(println discounted-prices) ; => (90.0 180.0 270.0)
```

In this example, `calculate-discount` is a pure function, and `apply-discounts` uses immutable data structures to apply the discount to a list of prices.

### Visualizing Immutability and Pure Functions

To better understand how data flows through pure functions and remains immutable, let's visualize these concepts using a flowchart:

```mermaid

    A[Input Data] --> B[Pure Function]
    B --> C[Output Data]
    C --> D[Immutable Data Structure]
    D --> E[New Immutable Data Structure]
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates how input data is processed by a pure function, resulting in output data that is stored in an immutable data structure. Any modifications result in new immutable data structures, preserving the original data.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored how pure functions and immutability work in Clojure, let's apply these concepts to manage state effectively in your applications. Try modifying the `apply-discounts` function to apply different discount rates to different price ranges.
