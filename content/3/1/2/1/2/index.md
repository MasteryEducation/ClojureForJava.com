## 2.1.2 Purpose and Use Cases of Design Patterns in Java

Design patterns are a critical aspect of software engineering, providing time-tested solutions to common design problems. In the realm of Java programming, design patterns serve as blueprints that help developers create robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. This section delves into the purpose of design patterns and explores their use cases in Java, offering insights into how they address specific design challenges and enhance the overall quality of software systems.

### The Purpose of Design Patterns

Design patterns serve multiple purposes in software development:

1. **Standardization**: They offer a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios. This standardization facilitates communication among developers and stakeholders, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

2. **Best Practices**: Design patterns encapsulate best practices that have been refined over time. By following these patterns, developers can avoid common pitfalls and implement solutions that are known to work effectively.

3. **Reusability**: Patterns promote code reusability by providing generic solutions that can be adapted to different problems. This reduces the need for redundant code and accelerates the development process.

4. **Maintainability**: By organizing code in a structured manner, design patterns make it easier to understand, modify, and extend. This is crucial for maintaining large codebases over time.

5. **Extensibility**: Patterns often include mechanisms for extending functionality without modifying existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle of software design.

### Use Cases of Design Patterns in Java

Let's explore some real-world scenarios where design patterns are effectively applied in Java applications.

#### 1. Singleton Pattern

**Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**Use Case**: Configuration management in an application often requires a single configuration object that is accessed by various components. The Singleton pattern is ideal for this scenario, ensuring that all parts of the application use the same configuration settings.

**Example**:
```java
public class ConfigurationManager {
    private static ConfigurationManager instance;
    private Properties configProperties;

    private ConfigurationManager() {
        // Load configuration properties
        configProperties = new Properties();
        // Load properties from a file or other source
    }

    public static synchronized ConfigurationManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ConfigurationManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public String getProperty(String key) {
        return configProperties.getProperty(key);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Factory Pattern

**Purpose**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

**Use Case**: In a graphic application, different types of shapes (circle, square, triangle) need to be created based on user input. The Factory pattern can be used to encapsulate the object creation logic, allowing for easy addition of new shapes.

**Example**:
```java
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}

public class Square implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
            return new Square();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Observer Pattern

**Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Use Case**: In a stock market application, the Observer pattern can be used to notify various components (e.g., display, logging, alert systems) when stock prices change.

**Example**:
```java
public interface Observer {
    void update(float price);
}

public class StockDisplay implements Observer {
    public void update(float price) {
        System.out.println("Stock price updated: " + price);
    }
}

public class Stock {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private float price;

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void setPrice(float price) {
        this.price = price;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    private void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(price);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Strategy Pattern

**Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Use Case**: In a payment processing system, different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) can be implemented as strategies, allowing the system to switch between them dynamically based on user choice.

**Example**:
```java
public interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

public class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using Credit Card");
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + amount + " using PayPal");
    }
}

public class PaymentContext {
    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executePayment(int amount) {
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

#### 5. Decorator Pattern

**Purpose**: Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Use Case**: In a text editor application, the Decorator pattern can be used to add features like spell-checking, grammar-checking, or text highlighting to a basic text editor component.

**Example**:
```java
public interface TextEditor {
    void display();
}

public class BasicTextEditor implements TextEditor {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying text");
    }
}

public class SpellCheckDecorator implements TextEditor {
    private TextEditor editor;

    public SpellCheckDecorator(TextEditor editor) {
        this.editor = editor;
    }

    public void display() {
        editor.display();
        System.out.println("Spell checking");
    }
}

public class GrammarCheckDecorator implements TextEditor {
    private TextEditor editor;

    public GrammarCheckDecorator(TextEditor editor) {
        this.editor = editor;
    }

    public void display() {
        editor.display();
        System.out.println("Grammar checking");
    }
}
```

#### 6. Command Pattern

**Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Use Case**: In a home automation system, the Command pattern can be used to encapsulate requests to turn on/off devices, allowing for easy implementation of features like undo/redo.

**Example**:
```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}

public class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;

    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }

    public void execute() {
        light.on();
    }
}

public class Light {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Light is on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Light is off");
    }
}

public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;

    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}
```

#### 7. Adapter Pattern

**Purpose**: Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

**Use Case**: In a legacy system integration, the Adapter pattern can be used to allow new components to interact with existing components that have different interfaces.

**Example**:
```java
public interface MediaPlayer {
    void play(String audioType, String fileName);
}

public class AudioPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("mp3")) {
            System.out.println("Playing mp3 file: " + fileName);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid media. " + audioType + " format not supported");
        }
    }
}

public interface AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    void playVlc(String fileName);
    void playMp4(String fileName);
}

public class VlcPlayer implements AdvancedMediaPlayer {
    public void playVlc(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing vlc file: " + fileName);
    }

    public void playMp4(String fileName) {
        // Do nothing
    }
}

public class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    AdvancedMediaPlayer advancedMusicPlayer;

    public MediaAdapter(String audioType) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            advancedMusicPlayer = new VlcPlayer();
        }
    }

    public void play(String audioType, String fileName) {
        if (audioType.equalsIgnoreCase("vlc")) {
            advancedMusicPlayer.playVlc(fileName);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 8. Facade Pattern

**Purpose**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

**Use Case**: In a complex system with multiple subsystems, the Facade pattern can simplify interactions by providing a single entry point for clients.

**Example**:
```java
public class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private Amplifier amp;
    private DvdPlayer dvd;
    private Projector projector;

    public HomeTheaterFacade(Amplifier amp, DvdPlayer dvd, Projector projector) {
        this.amp = amp;
        this.dvd = dvd;
        this.projector = projector;
    }

    public void watchMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Get ready to watch a movie...");
        projector.on();
        amp.on();
        dvd.on();
        dvd.play(movie);
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        System.out.println("Shutting movie theater down...");
        projector.off();
        amp.off();
        dvd.stop();
        dvd.off();
    }
}
```
