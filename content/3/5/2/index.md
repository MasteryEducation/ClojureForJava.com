## 5.2 Build Automation with Leiningen and deps.edn

Transitioning from Java to Clojure involves not only learning a new programming paradigm but also adapting to different tools and workflows. In Java, you might be accustomed to using build tools like Maven or Gradle. In the Clojure ecosystem, **Leiningen** and **deps.edn** are the primary tools for build automation and dependency management. This section will guide you through setting up and using these tools effectively, ensuring a smooth transition and efficient project management.

### Understanding Build Automation in Clojure

Build automation is crucial for managing dependencies, compiling code, running tests, and packaging applications. In Clojure, build tools also facilitate REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactions, which are central to the language's interactive development style.

#### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Libraries or modules your project relies on.
- **Build Configuration**: Instructions for compiling, testing, and packaging your code.
- **REPL Integration**: Interactive programming environment for testing and debugging.

### Leiningen: The Classic Clojure Build Tool

Leiningen is the most widely used build tool in the Clojure community. It simplifies project setup, dependency management, and task automation.

#### Installing Leiningen

To install Leiningen, follow these steps:

1. **Download the script**: Visit the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/) and download the script.
2. **Make it executable**: Run `chmod +x lein` in your terminal.
3. **Move it to your PATH**: Use `mv lein /usr/local/bin/` to make it accessible globally.

#### Creating a New Project

Leiningen makes it easy to start a new Clojure project:

```bash
lein new app my-clojure-app
```

This command creates a new directory `my-clojure-app` with a standard project structure.

#### Project Configuration with `project.clj`

The `project.clj` file is the heart of a Leiningen project. It defines project metadata, dependencies, and build instructions.

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A simple Clojure application"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

- **Dependencies**: Specify libraries your project depends on.
- **Main Namespace**: Define the entry point for your application.
- **Profiles**: Customize build configurations for different environments.

#### Running Tasks with Leiningen

Leiningen provides a variety of tasks to streamline development:

- **Run the application**: `lein run`
- **Start a REPL**: `lein repl`
- **Compile the code**: `lein compile`
- **Package as a JAR**: `lein uberjar`

### deps.edn: A Modern Approach to Dependency Management

While Leiningen is comprehensive, `deps.edn` offers a more lightweight and flexible approach, especially for dependency management and REPL-driven development.

#### Setting Up deps.edn

To use `deps.edn`, ensure you have the Clojure CLI tools installed. You can download them from the [Clojure website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).

#### Creating a deps.edn File

The `deps.edn` file is used to declare dependencies and aliases for your project.

```clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}
 :aliases {:dev {:extra-paths ["src/dev"]
                 :extra-deps {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.25.9"}}}}}
```

- **Dependencies**: Defined under the `:deps` key.
- **Aliases**: Custom configurations for different tasks or environments.

#### Running Clojure with deps.edn

The Clojure CLI provides commands to work with `deps.edn`:

- **Start a REPL**: `clj`
- **Run a script**: `clj -m my-clojure-app.core`
- **Add dependencies dynamically**: Use aliases to include additional libraries.

### Comparing Leiningen and deps.edn

Both tools have their strengths, and the choice between them depends on your project's needs.

#### Leiningen

- **Pros**: Comprehensive, supports plugins, widely adopted.
- **Cons**: Can be overkill for simple projects.

#### deps.edn

- **Pros**: Lightweight, flexible, ideal for REPL-driven development.
- **Cons**: Lacks built-in task automation (can be supplemented with tools like `make`).

### Configuring Projects for Team Collaboration

Effective collaboration requires consistent project configurations and dependency management.

#### Version Control

Ensure your `project.clj` or `deps.edn` files are included in version control to maintain consistency across team members.

#### Environment-Specific Configurations

Use profiles or aliases to manage environment-specific settings, such as development, testing, and production.

#### Continuous Integration

Integrate your build tool with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment. Both Leiningen and deps.edn can be configured to work with popular CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions.

### Code Examples

Let's explore some code examples to illustrate the use of Leiningen and deps.edn.

#### Leiningen Example

```clojure
;; project.clj
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A simple Clojure application"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[midje "1.9.9"]]}
             :uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

```clojure
;; src/my_clojure_app/core.clj
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:gen-class))

(defn -main
  "I don't do a whole lot ... yet."
  [& args]
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```

#### deps.edn Example

```clojure
;; deps.edn
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}}
 :aliases {:dev {:extra-deps {midje/midje {:mvn/version "1.9.9"}}}}}
```

```clojure
;; src/my_clojure_app/core.clj
(ns my-clojure-app.core)

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```

### Visual Aids

Below is a diagram illustrating the flow of data and tasks in a typical Clojure project using Leiningen and deps.edn.
