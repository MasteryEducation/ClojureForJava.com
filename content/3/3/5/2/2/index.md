## 11.2.2 Composing Middleware Layers

Middleware is a powerful concept in web development that allows developers to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. In Clojure, the Ring library provides a robust framework for building web applications, and middleware is a core component of this framework. This section delves into the composition of middleware layers in Clojure, demonstrating how middleware can be used to wrap handler functions, modify requests before they reach the handler, and alter responses before they are sent back to the client.

### Understanding Middleware in Ring

In the Ring library, middleware is essentially a higher-order function. It takes a handler function as an argument and returns a new handler function. This new handler can perform additional processing on the request or response, such as logging, authentication, or session management.

#### The `wrap-` Naming Convention

In Ring, middleware functions typically follow a `wrap-` naming convention. This convention helps to clearly identify functions that are intended to be used as middleware. Some common middleware functions include:

- `wrap-params`: Parses query parameters and form-encoded parameters into a map.
- `wrap-session`: Manages session state for requests.
- `wrap-keyword-params`: Converts string keys in the params map to keywords.
- `wrap-json-response`: Converts response bodies to JSON format.

### Composing Middleware

Composing middleware involves stacking multiple middleware functions around a core handler function. This composition allows for modular and reusable code, as each middleware function can focus on a specific aspect of request or response processing.

#### Basic Middleware Composition

Let's start with a simple example of middleware composition. Suppose we have a basic handler function that returns a greeting message:

```clojure
(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})
```

We can compose middleware around this handler to add functionality. For instance, we might want to log requests and manage sessions:

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.params :refer [wrap-params]]
         '[ring.middleware.session :refer [wrap-session]]
         '[ring.middleware.logger :refer [wrap-with-logger]])

(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-params
      wrap-session
      wrap-with-logger))
```

In this example, the `->` threading macro is used to apply each middleware function in sequence. The `wrap-params` middleware parses parameters, `wrap-session` manages session state, and `wrap-with-logger` logs each request.

#### Order of Middleware

The order in which middleware is composed is crucial, as each middleware function can affect the request and response. For example, `wrap-session` should be applied before any middleware that relies on session data. Consider the following example:

```clojure
(def app
  (-> handler
      wrap-with-logger
      wrap-session
      wrap-params))
```

In this case, logging occurs before session management, which might be useful for debugging purposes. However, if session data is required for logging, the order would need to be adjusted.

### Advanced Middleware Composition

Middleware can also be composed to handle more complex scenarios, such as authentication, error handling, and content negotiation.

#### Authentication Middleware

Authentication is a common requirement in web applications. Middleware can be used to enforce authentication by checking for valid credentials in the request:

```clojure
(defn wrap-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (if (authenticated? request)
      (handler request)
      {:status 401
       :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
       :body "Unauthorized"})))

(defn authenticated? [request]
  ;; Implement authentication logic here
  true)
```

This `wrap-authentication` middleware checks if a request is authenticated. If not, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response. Otherwise, it passes the request to the next handler.

#### Error Handling Middleware

Error handling can be centralized using middleware. This approach ensures consistent error responses across the application:

```clojure
(defn wrap-error-handling [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (try
      (handler request)
      (catch Exception e
        {:status 500
         :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
         :body "Internal Server Error"}))))
```

The `wrap-error-handling` middleware catches exceptions thrown by the handler and returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.

#### Content Negotiation Middleware

Content negotiation allows a server to serve different representations of a resource based on client preferences. Middleware can facilitate this process:

```clojure
(defn wrap-content-negotiation [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [accept (get-in request [:headers "accept"])]
      (cond
        (some #(= % "application/json") accept)
        (-> request
            (assoc :response-format :json)
            handler)

        (some #(= % "text/html") accept)
        (-> request
            (assoc :response-format :html)
            handler)

        :else
        {:status 406
         :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
         :body "Not Acceptable"}))))
```

This middleware checks the `Accept` header in the request and sets a `:response-format` key accordingly. If the requested format is not supported, it returns a 406 Not Acceptable response.

### Practical Example: Building a Middleware Stack

Let's build a complete middleware stack for a simple web application. This stack will include parameter parsing, session management, logging, authentication, error handling, and content negotiation.

```clojure
(defn app-handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "Welcome to the Clojure Web App!"})

(def app
  (-> app-handler
      wrap-params
      wrap-session
      wrap-with-logger
      wrap-authentication
      wrap-error-handling
      wrap-content-negotiation))
```

In this example, the `app` function is a fully composed middleware stack. Each middleware function adds a layer of functionality, resulting in a robust and maintainable web application.

### Best Practices for Middleware Composition

When composing middleware, consider the following best practices:

1. **Order Matters**: Carefully consider the order of middleware functions, as each can affect the request and response.

2. **Keep Middleware Focused**: Each middleware function should focus on a single aspect of request or response processing. This modularity makes middleware easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Reuse Middleware**: Leverage existing middleware libraries whenever possible. The Clojure ecosystem offers a wealth of middleware for common tasks.

4. **Test Middleware**: Ensure that middleware functions are thoroughly tested, particularly those that handle authentication, error handling, and other critical tasks.

5. **Document Middleware**: Clearly document the purpose and behavior of each middleware function, including any assumptions or dependencies.

### Conclusion

Middleware is a powerful tool for building web applications in Clojure. By composing middleware layers, developers can create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. This section has explored the basics of middleware composition, demonstrated advanced techniques, and highlighted best practices. With these tools and techniques, developers can build robust web applications that meet the needs of modern users.
