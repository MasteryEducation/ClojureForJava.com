## 8.1 Favoring Composition Over Inheritance

As we transition from Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm to Clojure's functional programming model, one of the most significant shifts is the move from inheritance to composition. This section will guide you through understanding why composition is favored in Clojure, how it enhances modularity and reusability, and how you can effectively apply composition patterns in your enterprise applications.

### Understanding Composition and Inheritance

**Inheritance** in Java OOP is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class, inheriting its fields and methods. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical class structures. However, inheritance can lead to complex and tightly coupled systems, making maintenance and scalability challenging.

**Composition**, on the other hand, involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. In Clojure, this is achieved through the use of functions and data structures rather than class hierarchies. Composition promotes flexibility and modularity, allowing for easier code maintenance and testing.

### Why Favor Composition Over Inheritance?

1. **Flexibility**: Composition allows you to change the behavior of a system by simply swapping out components. This is more challenging with inheritance, where changes often require modifying the class hierarchy.

2. **Reusability**: By composing functions and data structures, you can create reusable components that can be easily shared across different parts of an application.

3. **Simplicity**: Composition leads to simpler and more understandable code. It avoids the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies, which can be difficult to navigate and understand.

4. **Decoupling**: Composition decouples the implementation details from the interface, allowing for more robust and adaptable systems.

### Composition in Clojure: A Functional Approach

In Clojure, composition is a natural fit due to its functional nature. Let's explore how we can leverage Clojure's features to implement composition effectively.

#### Composing Functions

In Clojure, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables. This makes function composition a powerful tool.

```clojure
;; Define two simple functions
(defn add [x y]
  (+ x y))

(defn multiply [x y]
  (* x y))

;; Compose functions using the `comp` function
(def add-then-multiply (comp (partial multiply 2) (partial add 3)))

;; Use the composed function
(add-then-multiply 5) ;; => 16
```

In this example, we use the `comp` function to create a new function `add-then-multiply` that first adds 3 to its input and then multiplies the result by 2.

#### Composing Data Structures

Clojure's immutable data structures, such as maps, vectors, and sets, can be composed to create complex data models.

```clojure
;; Define a map representing a person
(def person {:name "Alice" :age 30})

;; Define a map representing an address
(def address {:street "123 Main St" :city "Springfield"})

;; Compose the person and address maps
(def person-with-address (merge person address))

;; Resulting map
;; {:name "Alice", :age 30, :street "123 Main St", :city "Springfield"}
```

Here, we use the `merge` function to compose two maps, creating a new map that combines the data from both.

#### Patterns for Composing Functions and Data Structures

1. **Pipeline Pattern**: Use the `->` (thread-first) and `->>` (thread-last) macros to create pipelines of function calls.

```clojure
;; Pipeline using the thread-first macro
(-> 5
    (add 3)
    (multiply 2)) ;; => 16
```

2. **Decorator Pattern**: Create higher-order functions that add behavior to existing functions.

```clojure
;; Define a logging decorator
(defn log-decorator [f]
  (fn [& args]
    (println "Calling function with args:" args)
    (apply f args)))

;; Decorate the add function
(def logged-add (log-decorator add))

;; Use the decorated function
(logged-add 3 4) ;; Logs: Calling function with args: (3 4) => 7
```

3. **Strategy Pattern**: Define a set of interchangeable algorithms and select one at runtime.

```clojure
;; Define strategies as functions
(defn strategy-a [x] (* x 2))
(defn strategy-b [x] (+ x 10))

;; Function to apply a strategy
(defn apply-strategy [strategy x]
  (strategy x))

;; Use different strategies
(apply-strategy strategy-a 5) ;; => 10
(apply-strategy strategy-b 5) ;; => 15
```

### Java OOP vs. Clojure Composition: A Comparison

To better understand the transition from Java OOP to Clojure's functional paradigm, let's compare how common design patterns are implemented in both languages.

#### Java Inheritance Example

```java
// Base class
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

// Usage
Animal myDog = new Dog();
myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Bark
```

#### Clojure Composition Example

```clojure
;; Define a function for the base behavior
(defn make-sound []
  (println "Some sound"))

;; Define a function for the derived behavior
(defn dog-sound []
  (println "Bark"))

;; Compose behaviors using a map
(def animal {:make-sound make-sound})
(def dog (assoc animal :make-sound dog-sound))

;; Usage
((:make-sound dog)) ;; Outputs: Bark
```

In the Clojure example, we use a map to compose behaviors, allowing us to easily swap out or extend functionality without modifying a class hierarchy.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following exercises to deepen your understanding of composition in Clojure:

1. **Modify the Function Composition**: Change the `add-then-multiply` function to first multiply by 3 and then add 5. Test it with different inputs.

2. **Create a New Data Structure Composition**: Define two maps representing a book and its author. Compose them into a single map and print the result.

3. **Implement a New Strategy**: Add a new strategy function that subtracts 5 from its input. Use `apply-strategy` to test all strategies with the input 10.

### Visual Aids

To further illustrate the concept of composition over inheritance, let's use a diagram to compare the two approaches.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Java Class Hierarchy] -->|Inheritance| B[Base Class]
    B --> C[Derived Class 1]
    B --> D[Derived Class 2]

    E[Clojure Composition] -->|Function Composition| F[Function 1]
    E -->|Data Structure Composition| G[Map 1]
    E -->|Strategy Pattern| H[Strategy Function]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram contrasts the Java class hierarchy using inheritance with Clojure's composition approach, highlighting function and data structure composition as well as the strategy pattern.
