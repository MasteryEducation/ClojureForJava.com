## B.1 Syntax Quick Reference

Welcome to the Clojure Syntax Quick Reference, a comprehensive guide designed specifically for Java professionals venturing into the world of functional programming with Clojure. This guide serves as a cheat sheet, covering essential Clojure syntax, including literals, special forms, core functions, and macros. As you transition from Java's object-oriented paradigm to Clojure's functional approach, this reference will help you grasp the nuances of Clojure's syntax and idioms.

### Introduction to Clojure Syntax

Clojure is a dynamic, functional programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It emphasizes immutability, first-class functions, and a minimalist syntax. Unlike Java, Clojure's syntax is concise and expressive, allowing developers to write powerful code with fewer lines.

#### Key Differences from Java

- **Immutability**: Clojure's data structures are immutable by default, promoting safer concurrency and easier reasoning about code.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are first-class citizens in Clojure, enabling higher-order functions and function composition.
- **Minimal Syntax**: Clojure's syntax is simple, with a focus on expressions rather than statements.

### Clojure Literals

Literals in Clojure represent fixed values in the code. They include numbers, strings, characters, keywords, symbols, lists, vectors, maps, and sets.

#### Numbers

Clojure supports various numeric types, including integers, floating-point numbers, ratios, and big integers.

```clojure
42        ; Integer
3.14      ; Floating-point number
22/7      ; Ratio
2N        ; Big integer
```

#### Strings

Strings in Clojure are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.

```clojure
"Hello, Clojure!"  ; String literal
```

#### Characters

Characters are prefixed with a backslash.

```clojure
\a  ; Character 'a'
\n  ; Newline character
```

#### Keywords

Keywords are identifiers that begin with a colon and are often used as keys in maps.

```clojure
:keyword  ; Keyword
```

#### Symbols

Symbols are used to refer to variables and functions.

```clojure
foo  ; Symbol
```

#### Lists

Lists are ordered collections of elements, typically used to represent code.

```clojure
'(1 2 3)  ; List
```

#### Vectors

Vectors are indexed collections, similar to arrays in Java.

```clojure
[1 2 3]  ; Vector
```

#### Maps

Maps are collections of key-value pairs.

```clojure
{:name "Alice" :age 30}  ; Map
```

#### Sets

Sets are collections of unique elements.

```clojure
#{1 2 3}  ; Set
```

### Special Forms

Special forms are fundamental constructs in Clojure that provide the building blocks for more complex expressions. They include `def`, `if`, `do`, `let`, `fn`, `quote`, `var`, `loop`, `recur`, `throw`, `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.

#### `def`

Defines a new variable or function.

```clojure
(def x 10)  ; Define a variable x with value 10
```

#### `if`

Conditional expression that evaluates one of two branches.

```clojure
(if (> 10 5)
  "Greater"
  "Lesser")  ; Evaluates to "Greater"
```

#### `do`

Groups multiple expressions, returning the value of the last expression.

```clojure
(do
  (println "Hello")
  (+ 1 2))  ; Returns 3
```

#### `let`

Binds variables to values within a local scope.

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))  ; Returns 30
```

#### `fn`

Defines an anonymous function.

```clojure
(fn [x] (* x x))  ; Function that squares its argument
```

#### `quote`

Prevents evaluation of an expression.

```clojure
(quote (1 2 3))  ; Returns the list (1 2 3)
```

#### `var`

Refers to a variable in the current namespace.

```clojure
(var x)  ; Refers to the variable x
```

#### `loop` and `recur`

Used for recursion with tail-call optimization.

```clojure
(loop [i 0]
  (when (< i 10)
    (println i)
    (recur (inc i))))  ; Prints numbers 0 to 9
```

#### `throw`, `try`, `catch`, and `finally`

Used for exception handling.

```clojure
(try
  (/ 1 0)
  (catch ArithmeticException e
    (println "Cannot divide by zero"))
  (finally
    (println "Cleanup")))  ; Prints error message and "Cleanup"
```

### Core Functions

Clojure provides a rich set of core functions for manipulating data structures, performing arithmetic operations, and more. Here are some commonly used functions:

#### Arithmetic Functions

```clojure
(+ 1 2 3)  ; Addition, returns 6
(- 10 5)   ; Subtraction, returns 5
(* 2 3)    ; Multiplication, returns 6
(/ 10 2)   ; Division, returns 5
```

#### Collection Functions

```clojure
(conj [1 2] 3)  ; Adds an element to a collection, returns [1 2 3]
(first [1 2 3]) ; Returns the first element, 1
(rest [1 2 3])  ; Returns the rest of the elements, (2 3)
(map inc [1 2 3])  ; Applies a function to each element, returns (2 3 4)
(filter even? [1 2 3 4])  ; Filters elements, returns (2 4)
(reduce + [1 2 3 4])  ; Reduces a collection, returns 10
```

#### String Functions

```clojure
(str "Hello, " "World!")  ; Concatenates strings, returns "Hello, World!"
(clojure.string/upper-case "hello")  ; Converts to uppercase, returns "HELLO"
(clojure.string/split "a,b,c" #",")  ; Splits a string, returns ["a" "b" "c"]
```

#### Sequence Functions

```clojure
(seq [1 2 3])  ; Converts a collection to a sequence, returns (1 2 3)
(cons 0 [1 2 3])  ; Adds an element to the front, returns (0 1 2 3)
(interleave [1 2] [3 4])  ; Interleaves two sequences, returns (1 3 2 4)
```

### Macros

Macros in Clojure allow you to extend the language by defining new syntactic constructs. They are a powerful feature that enables metaprogramming.

#### `defmacro`

Defines a macro.

```clojure
(defmacro unless [condition & body]
  `(if (not ~condition)
     (do ~@body)))  ; Macro that acts like an inverted if
```

#### `->` and `->>`

Threading macros for chaining expressions.

```clojure
(-> 5
    (+ 3)
    (* 2))  ; Threads the value through, returns 16

(->> [1 2 3]
     (map inc)
     (filter even?))  ; Threads the collection through, returns (2 4)
```

#### `letfn`

Defines local functions.

```clojure
(letfn [(square [x] (* x x))
        (cube [x] (* x x x))]
  (println (square 3))
  (println (cube 3)))  ; Prints 9 and 27
```

### Best Practices

- **Embrace Immutability**: Use immutable data structures to simplify reasoning about code and ensure thread safety.
- **Leverage Higher-Order Functions**: Utilize functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to operate on collections.
- **Use Destructuring**: Simplify code by destructuring collections in `let`, `fn`, and other forms.
- **Write Pure Functions**: Aim for functions without side effects to enhance testability and composability.
- **Utilize REPL**: Take advantage of the REPL for interactive development and testing.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Mutable State**: Avoid mutable state and side effects, which can lead to bugs and concurrency issues.
- **Overusing Macros**: Use macros judiciously, as they can complicate code and hinder readability.
- **Ignoring Lazy Evaluation**: Be mindful of lazy sequences, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not consumed properly.

### Optimization Tips

- **Profile Code**: Use tools like `criterium` for benchmarking and optimizing performance-critical code.
- **Prefer `reduce` over Recursion**: Use `reduce` for accumulation tasks to avoid stack overflow errors.
- **Optimize Hot Paths**: Identify and optimize frequently executed code paths for better performance.
