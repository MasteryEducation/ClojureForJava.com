## B.2 Commonly Used Functions and Macros

Clojure, as a functional programming language, provides a rich set of functions and macros that allow developers to write concise, expressive, and efficient code. For Java professionals transitioning to Clojure, understanding these core constructs is crucial to harnessing the full power of the language. This section delves into some of the most commonly used functions and macros in Clojure, providing detailed explanations and practical examples to illustrate their usage.

### 1. `map`

The `map` function is a cornerstone of functional programming in Clojure. It applies a given function to each element of a collection, returning a lazy sequence of results.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(map square [1 2 3 4 5])
;; => (1 4 9 16 25)
```

In this example, `map` applies the `square` function to each element of the vector `[1 2 3 4 5]`, resulting in a sequence of squared numbers.

#### Key Points
- `map` is lazy, meaning it computes elements only as needed.
- It can be used with multiple collections, applying the function to corresponding elements.

```clojure
(map + [1 2 3] [4 5 6])
;; => (5 7 9)
```

### 2. `reduce`

`reduce` is used to accumulate a result by applying a function to an initial value and the elements of a collection.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
;; => 15
```

Here, `reduce` sums up the elements of the vector `[1 2 3 4 5]`, starting with an initial value of `0`.

#### Key Points
- `reduce` is eager, processing the entire collection.
- It is often used for operations like summing, finding maximum/minimum, or combining elements.

```clojure
(reduce max [1 3 2 5 4])
;; => 5
```

### 3. `filter`

The `filter` function returns a lazy sequence of elements from a collection that satisfy a predicate function.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(filter even? [1 2 3 4 5 6])
;; => (2 4 6)
```

In this example, `filter` selects only the even numbers from the vector `[1 2 3 4 5 6]`.

#### Key Points
- `filter` is lazy, producing elements as needed.
- It is useful for extracting subsets of data based on conditions.

### 4. `let`

`let` is a macro for creating local bindings, allowing you to define temporary variables within a scope.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(let [x 2
      y 3]
  (+ x y))
;; => 5
```

Here, `let` binds `x` to `2` and `y` to `3`, and the expression `(+ x y)` evaluates to `5`.

#### Key Points
- `let` is used for scoping and organizing code.
- It helps avoid variable name clashes and improves readability.

### 5. `defn`

`defn` is a macro for defining functions. It combines `def` and `fn` to create a named function.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(defn greet [name]
  (str "Hello, " name "!"))

(greet "Alice")
;; => "Hello, Alice!"
```

In this example, `defn` defines a function `greet` that takes a name and returns a greeting string.

#### Key Points
- `defn` supports optional docstrings and metadata.
- It is the primary way to define reusable functions in Clojure.

### 6. `if`

The `if` macro is used for conditional expressions, evaluating one of two branches based on a condition.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(if (> 3 2)
  "Greater"
  "Smaller")
;; => "Greater"
```

Here, `if` checks if `3` is greater than `2`, returning "Greater" since the condition is true.

#### Key Points
- `if` requires a condition, a then-branch, and an optional else-branch.
- It is fundamental for decision-making in Clojure.

### 7. `cond`

`cond` is a macro for handling multiple conditional branches, similar to a switch-case statement.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(cond
  (< 3 2) "Less"
  (> 3 2) "Greater"
  :else "Equal")
;; => "Greater"
```

In this example, `cond` evaluates each condition in order and returns the corresponding result for the first true condition.

#### Key Points
- `cond` is more readable than nested `if` statements for multiple conditions.
- The `:else` keyword is used for a default case.

### 8. `fn`

`fn` is used to create anonymous functions, often for short-lived or inline use.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(map (fn [x] (* x x)) [1 2 3 4 5])
;; => (1 4 9 16 25)
```

Here, `fn` creates an anonymous function to square numbers, used directly within `map`.

#### Key Points
- `fn` is ideal for small, unnamed functions.
- It supports destructuring and variadic arguments.

### 9. `doseq`

`doseq` is a macro for iterating over collections, primarily for side effects.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(doseq [n [1 2 3]]
  (println n))
;; Prints:
;; 1
;; 2
;; 3
```

In this example, `doseq` iterates over the vector `[1 2 3]`, printing each element.

#### Key Points
- `doseq` is not lazy; it processes all elements immediately.
- It is used when the primary goal is side effects, like printing or logging.

### 10. `for`

`for` is a macro for list comprehensions, generating sequences based on input collections and conditions.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(for [x [1 2 3]
      y [4 5 6]]
  (* x y))
;; => (4 5 6 8 10 12 12 15 18)
```

Here, `for` creates a sequence by multiplying each combination of `x` and `y`.

#### Key Points
- `for` is lazy, producing elements as needed.
- It supports filtering and multiple input collections.

### 11. `def`

`def` is used to define global variables or constants.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(def pi 3.14159)

(* pi 2)
;; => 6.28318
```

In this example, `def` binds `pi` to the value `3.14159`, which can be used globally.

#### Key Points
- `def` is used for top-level bindings.
- Avoid using `def` for mutable state to maintain functional purity.

### 12. `loop` and `recur`

`loop` and `recur` are used for creating recursive loops, allowing tail-call optimization.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (loop [acc 1, n n]
    (if (zero? n)
      acc
      (recur (* acc n) (dec n)))))

(factorial 5)
;; => 120
```

Here, `loop` initializes `acc` and `n`, and `recur` updates them until `n` is zero.

#### Key Points
- `recur` must be in the tail position for optimization.
- `loop` provides a way to manage state across iterations.

### 13. `quote` and `syntax-quote`

`quote` prevents evaluation of a form, while `syntax-quote` (`\``) allows for unquoting (`~`) and splicing (`~@`).

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(quote (+ 1 2))
;; => (+ 1 2)

`(+ 1 ~(+ 2 3))
;; => (+ 1 5)
```

In these examples, `quote` and `syntax-quote` control evaluation and allow code generation.

#### Key Points
- `quote` is used to treat code as data.
- `syntax-quote` is powerful for macros and code templates.

### 14. `macro`

Macros allow developers to extend the language by defining new syntactic constructs.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(defmacro unless [condition & body]
  `(if (not ~condition)
     (do ~@body)))

(unless false
  (println "This will print"))
;; Prints: This will print
```

Here, `unless` is a macro that inverts the condition for an `if` statement.

#### Key Points
- Macros operate on code, not values.
- They enable domain-specific language creation and syntactic abstraction.

### 15. `try`, `catch`, `finally`

These are used for exception handling in Clojure.

#### Usage Example

```clojure
(try
  (/ 1 0)
  (catch ArithmeticException e
    (println "Cannot divide by zero"))
  (finally
    (println "Cleanup")))
;; Prints:
;; Cannot divide by zero
;; Cleanup
```

In this example, `try`, `catch`, and `finally` manage exceptions and cleanup.

#### Key Points
- `try` handles exceptions with `catch` clauses.
- `finally` executes regardless of exceptions.

### Conclusion

Understanding and effectively using these functions and macros is essential for writing idiomatic and efficient Clojure code. They form the building blocks of functional programming in Clojure, enabling developers to write concise, expressive, and maintainable code. As you transition from Java to Clojure, mastering these constructs will significantly enhance your ability to leverage Clojure's functional paradigm.
