## 11.1.1 Overview of Popular IDEs and Plugins

In the realm of Clojure development, choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor can significantly enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow. This section delves into some of the most popular IDEs and plugins used by Clojure developers, including Emacs with CIDER, IntelliJ IDEA with Cursive, VSCode with Calva, and Atom with Chlorine. We will explore the features each environment offers, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, REPL integration, and debugging tools, and provide detailed installation and configuration steps to get you started.

### Emacs with CIDER

Emacs, a powerful and extensible text editor, has been a favorite among Clojure developers for years, primarily due to the CIDER (Clojure Interactive Development Environment that Rocks) plugin. CIDER provides a rich set of features tailored for Clojure development.

#### Key Features

- **REPL Integration**: CIDER offers seamless REPL integration, allowing you to evaluate code, test functions, and debug directly within Emacs.
- **Code Navigation**: Navigate through your codebase with ease using features like jump to definition and find references.
- **Interactive Debugging**: CIDER provides an interactive debugger that lets you set breakpoints and inspect variables.
- **Syntax Highlighting and Code Completion**: Enjoy advanced syntax highlighting and code completion powered by Clojure's dynamic nature.

#### Installation and Configuration

1. **Install Emacs**: Download and install Emacs from [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).
2. **Install CIDER**: Use Emacs' package manager to install CIDER. Add the following to your Emacs configuration file (`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`):

   ```elisp
   (require 'package)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
   (package-initialize)
   (unless (package-installed-p 'cider)
     (package-refresh-contents)
     (package-install 'cider))
   ```

3. **Configure CIDER**: Customize CIDER settings in your Emacs configuration file to enhance your development experience:

   ```elisp
   (setq cider-repl-display-help-banner nil)
   (setq cider-show-error-buffer t)
   (setq cider-auto-select-error-buffer t)
   ```

4. **Start a Clojure Project**: Open a Clojure file and start a REPL session with `M-x cider-jack-in`.
