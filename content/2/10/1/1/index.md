## 10.1.1 Setting Up Routes and Handlers

In the realm of Clojure web development, understanding how to set up routes and handlers is crucial for creating robust web applications. This section delves into the foundational aspects of using the Ring library and Compojure to build and manage HTTP routes and handlers. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to structure your Clojure web applications effectively.

### Introduction to Ring

Ring is the cornerstone of web development in Clojure. It provides a simple and flexible interface for handling HTTP requests and responses. At its core, Ring defines a request as a Clojure map and a response as another map, making it easy to manipulate HTTP data using Clojure's powerful data structures.

#### Key Concepts of Ring

- **Request Map**: Represents an incoming HTTP request. It includes keys such as `:request-method`, `:uri`, `:headers`, and `:body`.
- **Response Map**: Represents the HTTP response to be sent back to the client. It typically contains keys like `:status`, `:headers`, and `:body`.
- **Middleware**: Functions that wrap handlers to modify requests or responses, adding capabilities like logging, authentication, or session management.

### Building on Ring with Compojure

While Ring provides the foundational HTTP server interface, Compojure extends it by offering a concise and expressive way to define routes. Compojure allows you to map HTTP verbs and paths to handler functions, making it easier to build RESTful APIs and web applications.

#### Setting Up a New Project

To get started with Ring and Compojure, you'll need to set up a new Clojure project. We'll use Leiningen, a popular build automation tool for Clojure, to manage our project dependencies and build configurations.

1. **Create a New Leiningen Project**:

   ```bash
   lein new compojure-app my-web-app
   ```

2. **Add Dependencies**:

   Open the `project.clj` file and add the following dependencies:

   ```clojure
   :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                  [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]
                  [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.9.0"]
                  [compojure "1.6.2"]]
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:

   Navigate to your project directory and start the server:

   ```bash
   lein ring server
   ```

### Defining Routes with Compojure

Compojure provides the `defroutes` macro to define routes in a declarative manner. You can map HTTP methods and paths to specific handler functions, which process requests and return responses.

#### Basic Route Definition

Here's a simple example of defining routes using Compojure:

```clojure
(ns my-web-app.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Welcome to my web app!")
  (GET "/hello/:name" [name] (str "Hello, " name "!"))
  (POST "/submit" req (str "Data submitted: " (:body req))))

(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app-routes {:port 3000}))
```

- **GET "/"**: A route that responds with a simple welcome message.
- **GET "/hello/:name"**: A dynamic route that captures a URL parameter `name` and responds with a personalized greeting.
- **POST "/submit"**: A route that handles POST requests, accessing the request body.

### Handling Responses

In Compojure, handler functions return response maps. You can customize these responses with status codes, headers, and body content.

#### Example of a Custom Response

```clojure
(defn custom-response []
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "This is a custom response."})
```

### Managing URL Parameters and Query Strings

Compojure makes it easy to work with URL parameters and query strings. You can destructure parameters directly in the route definition.

#### URL Parameters

In the route `GET "/hello/:name"`, the `:name` parameter is captured and passed to the handler function. This allows you to create dynamic responses based on the URL.

#### Query Strings

To handle query strings, you can access the `:query-params` key in the request map:

```clojure
(GET "/search" req
  (let [query (:query-params req)]
    (str "Search results for: " (:q query))))
```

### Organizing Routes for Maintainability

As your application grows, organizing routes becomes essential for maintainability and clarity. Here are some best practices:

- **Modularize Routes**: Break down routes into smaller modules or namespaces based on functionality.
- **Use Route Groups**: Group related routes using `context` or `routes` to keep your code organized.
- **Document Routes**: Clearly document each route's purpose, expected parameters, and response format.

### Conclusion

Setting up routes and handlers in Clojure using Ring and Compojure is a powerful way to build web applications. By understanding the fundamentals of Ring and leveraging Compojure's routing capabilities, you can create clean, maintainable, and efficient web applications. Remember to organize your routes logically and document them thoroughly to ensure your codebase remains manageable as it scales.
