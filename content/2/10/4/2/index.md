## 10.4.2 JSON Handling and API Documentation

In the world of web development, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) has become the de facto standard for data interchange. As a Clojure developer, mastering JSON handling and API documentation is crucial for building robust and maintainable web services. This section will guide you through using libraries like Cheshire for JSON processing, structuring API responses, integrating documentation tools like Swagger, and addressing security and versioning concerns.

### JSON Handling with Cheshire

Cheshire is a popular Clojure library for encoding and decoding JSON data. It provides a simple and efficient way to work with JSON, making it a go-to choice for many Clojure developers.

#### Installing Cheshire

To get started with Cheshire, add it to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
(defproject my-api "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [cheshire "5.10.0"]])
```

#### Encoding and Decoding JSON

Cheshire makes it easy to convert between Clojure data structures and JSON.

**Encoding Clojure Data to JSON:**

```clojure
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])

(def data {:name "John Doe" :age 30 :email "john.doe@example.com"})

(def json-string (json/generate-string data))
;; => "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30,\"email\":\"john.doe@example.com\"}"
```

**Decoding JSON to Clojure Data:**

```clojure
(def json-data "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30,\"email\":\"john.doe@example.com\"}")

(def clojure-data (json/parse-string json-data true))
;; => {:name "John Doe", :age 30, :email "john.doe@example.com"}
```

The `true` argument in `parse-string` indicates that keys should be converted to keywords.

#### Customizing JSON Encoding

Cheshire allows customization of JSON encoding through custom encoders. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex data types.

```clojure
(defrecord User [name age email])

(extend-protocol json/JSONable
  User
  (to-json [user]
    {:name (:name user)
     :age (:age user)
     :email (:email user)}))

(def user (->User "Jane Doe" 28 "jane.doe@example.com"))

(def user-json (json/generate-string user))
;; => "{\"name\":\"Jane Doe\",\"age\":28,\"email\":\"jane.doe@example.com\"}"
```

### Best Practices for Structuring API Responses

A well-structured API response enhances the client experience and simplifies integration. Here are some best practices:

#### Consistent Response Format

Ensure that all API responses follow a consistent structure. A common pattern is to include `data`, `error`, and `meta` fields.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  },
  "error": null,
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "abc123",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

#### Clear Error Messages

Provide meaningful error messages and codes. This helps clients understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The user with the specified ID was not found."
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "def456",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T12:35:56Z"
  }
}
```

#### Pagination and Filtering

For endpoints that return lists of resources, implement pagination and filtering to improve performance and usability.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Doe"}
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 10
  }
}
```

### API Documentation with Swagger

Swagger, now part of the OpenAPI Initiative, is a powerful tool for documenting APIs. It provides a standard way to describe your API's endpoints, request/response formats, and more.

#### Integrating Swagger with Clojure

To integrate Swagger, you can use libraries like [ring-swagger](https://github.com/metosin/ring-swagger) which work seamlessly with Clojure web applications.

**Adding Dependencies:**

```clojure
(defproject my-api "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [metosin/ring-swagger "0.26.2"]
                 [metosin/compojure-api "2.0.0-alpha30"]])
```

**Defining API with Swagger Annotations:**

```clojure
(require '[compojure.api.sweet :refer :all]
         '[ring.util.http-response :refer :all])

(defapi app
  (swagger-ui)
  (swagger-docs
    {:info {:title "My API"
            :description "API for managing users"}})

  (GET "/users/:id" []
    :path-params [id :- Long]
    :return {:id Long :name String}
    :summary "Fetch a user by ID"
    (ok {:id id :name "John Doe"})))
```

The above example sets up a simple API with Swagger documentation. The `swagger-ui` function provides a web-based interface for exploring the API.

#### Generating API Documentation

Swagger UI automatically generates interactive documentation based on your API definitions. This documentation allows developers to test endpoints and understand the API's capabilities.

### Versioning APIs and Managing Breaking Changes

APIs evolve over time, and managing changes without breaking existing clients is crucial.

#### Versioning Strategies

1. **URI Versioning:** Include the version number in the URL path.

   ```
   GET /v1/users/1
   ```

2. **Header Versioning:** Use custom headers to specify the API version.

   ```
   GET /users/1
   Headers: X-API-Version: 1
   ```

3. **Query Parameter Versioning:** Include the version as a query parameter.

   ```
   GET /users/1?version=1
   ```

#### Handling Breaking Changes

- **Deprecation Notices:** Inform clients about deprecated features and provide a timeline for their removal.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Strive to maintain backward compatibility by adding new fields instead of changing existing ones.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure thorough testing of new versions to prevent regressions.

### Security Considerations

Securing your API is paramount to protect sensitive data and ensure reliable service.

#### Authentication and Authorization

Implement robust authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identities and authorize access to resources.

#### Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage by implementing rate limiting. Libraries like [clj-rate-limit](https://github.com/jaymcl/clj-rate-limit) can help manage request rates.

#### Data Validation and Sanitization

Validate and sanitize all input data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Use libraries like [clojure.spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) for defining and enforcing data specifications.

### Conclusion

Mastering JSON handling and API documentation in Clojure involves understanding the tools and best practices that make your APIs robust, maintainable, and secure. By leveraging libraries like Cheshire for JSON processing, adopting Swagger for comprehensive documentation, and implementing security measures, you can build APIs that stand the test of time.
