## 7.5.2 Developing with Component and Mount

In the world of Clojure development, managing application state and ensuring smooth transitions during code changes are crucial for maintaining productivity and system reliability. Two powerful libraries, `Component` and `Mount`, have emerged as popular solutions for handling these challenges. This section will delve into how these libraries can be leveraged to manage application state, facilitate hot reloading, and enhance the overall development workflow.

### Overview of Component and Mount

Both `Component` and `Mount` provide mechanisms for managing the lifecycle of stateful components in a Clojure application. They help in organizing and structuring applications, making it easier to manage dependencies and state transitions. While they share similar goals, they approach the problem differently, offering distinct advantages.

#### Component Library

The `Component` library, developed by Stuart Sierra, is based on the idea of defining system components with explicit lifecycle protocols. Each component can be started, stopped, and restarted, allowing for precise control over the application's state.

- **Lifecycle Management**: Components implement a lifecycle protocol with `start` and `stop` methods, enabling controlled initialization and cleanup.
- **Dependency Injection**: Components can declare dependencies on other components, facilitating dependency management and ensuring correct startup order.
- **System Composition**: A system is composed of multiple components, each responsible for a specific part of the application, such as database connections or web servers.

#### Mount Library

`Mount`, on the other hand, takes a more declarative approach. It focuses on defining stateful components as vars, which are automatically managed by the library.

- **State as Vars**: State is defined using vars, which are automatically started and stopped by Mount.
- **Simplicity**: Mount's approach is more straightforward, with less boilerplate code compared to Component.
- **Hot Reloading**: Mount excels in facilitating hot reloading, allowing developers to reload code without restarting the entire application.

### Defining System Components and Managing Lifecycles

Both libraries provide mechanisms to define system components and manage their lifecycles, but they do so in different ways.

#### Using Component

To define a component in the `Component` library, you create a record that implements the `Lifecycle` protocol. This protocol requires `start` and `stop` methods, which manage the component's resources.

```clojure
(ns myapp.components.database
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]))

(defrecord Database [connection]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (println "Starting database connection")
    (assoc this :connection (connect-to-database)))
  (stop [this]
    (println "Stopping database connection")
    (disconnect-from-database (:connection this))
    (assoc this :connection nil)))

(defn new-database []
  (map->Database {}))
```

In this example, the `Database` component manages a database connection, starting and stopping it as needed.

#### Using Mount

With `Mount`, you define stateful components as vars using the `defstate` macro. The state is automatically managed by Mount, simplifying the lifecycle management.

```clojure
(ns myapp.state
  (:require [mount.core :refer [defstate]]))

(defstate database
  :start (do
           (println "Starting database connection")
           (connect-to-database))
  :stop (do
          (println "Stopping database connection")
          (disconnect-from-database database)))
```

Here, the `database` state is defined using `defstate`, with `:start` and `:stop` keys to manage the connection lifecycle.

### Facilitating Hot Reloading

Hot reloading is a crucial feature for maintaining developer productivity, allowing code changes to be applied without restarting the entire application. Both `Component` and `Mount` support this, albeit in different ways.

#### Hot Reloading with Component

To enable hot reloading with `Component`, you typically use a REPL-driven workflow. By restarting individual components, you can apply changes without affecting the entire system.

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [myapp.system :as system]
            [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]))

(defonce system-instance (atom nil))

(defn start []
  (reset! system-instance (component/start (system/new-system))))

(defn stop []
  (when @system-instance
    (component/stop @system-instance)))

(defn reset []
  (stop)
  (start))
```

This setup allows you to start, stop, and reset the system from the REPL, facilitating hot reloading.

#### Hot Reloading with Mount

Mount's declarative approach makes hot reloading even simpler. By using the `mount.core/stop` and `mount.core/start` functions, you can reload specific states or the entire system.

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [mount.core :as mount]
            myapp.state))

(defn reset []
  (mount/stop)
  (mount/start))
```

This minimal setup allows you to reload the application state with ease, making it ideal for rapid development cycles.

### Step-by-Step Integration Examples

Let's walk through integrating `Component` and `Mount` into a sample Clojure project.

#### Integrating Component

1. **Define Components**: Create records for each component, implementing the `Lifecycle` protocol.

   ```clojure
   (defrecord WebServer [port]
     component/Lifecycle
     (start [this]
       (println "Starting web server on port" port)
       (assoc this :server (start-server port)))
     (stop [this]
       (println "Stopping web server")
       (stop-server (:server this))
       (assoc this :server nil)))

   (defn new-web-server [port]
     (map->WebServer {:port port}))
   ```

2. **Compose System**: Define a system map that includes all components.

   ```clojure
   (defn new-system []
     (component/system-map
       :database (new-database)
       :web-server (new-web-server 8080)))
   ```

3. **Manage Lifecycle**: Use the REPL to start, stop, and reset the system.

   ```clojure
   (defonce system-instance (atom nil))

   (defn start []
     (reset! system-instance (component/start (new-system))))

   (defn stop []
     (when @system-instance
       (component/stop @system-instance)))

   (defn reset []
     (stop)
     (start))
   ```

#### Integrating Mount

1. **Define States**: Use `defstate` to define each stateful component.

   ```clojure
   (defstate web-server
     :start (do
              (println "Starting web server on port 8080")
              (start-server 8080))
     :stop (do
             (println "Stopping web server")
             (stop-server web-server)))
   ```

2. **Start and Stop**: Use Mount's start and stop functions to manage the application state.

   ```clojure
   (mount/start)
   (mount/stop)
   ```

3. **Hot Reloading**: Reload the application state from the REPL.

   ```clojure
   (defn reset []
     (mount/stop)
     (mount/start))
   ```

### Best Practices for Structuring Applications

To maximize the benefits of live coding and state management, consider the following best practices:

- **Modular Design**: Break down your application into small, independent components or states. This modularity simplifies testing and maintenance.
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly define dependencies between components to ensure correct initialization order and avoid circular dependencies.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from lifecycle management. Use components or states to manage resources, not application logic.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for components and states to improve readability and maintainability.
- **REPL-Driven Development**: Leverage the REPL for interactive development, using hot reloading to apply changes quickly.

### Conclusion

The `Component` and `Mount` libraries offer powerful tools for managing application state and facilitating hot reloading in Clojure projects. By understanding their differences and strengths, you can choose the right tool for your needs and enhance your development workflow. Whether you prefer the explicit lifecycle management of `Component` or the simplicity of `Mount`, both libraries provide valuable capabilities for building robust, maintainable applications.
