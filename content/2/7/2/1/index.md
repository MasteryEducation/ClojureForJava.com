## 7.2.1 Using Leiningen and Boot REPLs

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is a cornerstone of Clojure development, offering a dynamic and interactive programming environment that enhances productivity and facilitates rapid experimentation. For Java engineers transitioning to Clojure, mastering the REPL is crucial for leveraging the full power of functional programming. In this section, we delve into using Leiningen and Boot to start and configure REPL sessions, highlighting their differences, capabilities, and best practices for an optimized development workflow.

### Starting a REPL Session with Leiningen

Leiningen is a popular build automation tool for Clojure, known for its simplicity and extensive plugin ecosystem. Starting a REPL session with Leiningen is straightforward:

```bash
lein repl
```

This command initiates a REPL session within the context of your Leiningen project, loading the project's dependencies and source paths. Leiningen's REPL is highly configurable, allowing you to customize the environment to suit your development needs.

#### Configuring Leiningen REPL

Leiningen's configuration is primarily managed through the `project.clj` file. Here, you can define dependencies, source paths, and other project-specific settings. To configure the REPL environment, consider the following aspects:

- **Classpath Management:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies are listed under the `:dependencies` key in `project.clj`. This ensures that the REPL has access to all required libraries.

- **Profiles:** Leiningen supports profiles, which allow you to define environment-specific settings. For example, you can create a `:dev` profile for development-specific dependencies and configurations.

```clojure
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[midje "1.9.9"]]}}
```

- **REPL Initialization:** Use the `:repl-options` key to specify initialization code or customizations for the REPL session. For instance, you can preload namespaces or set a custom prompt.

```clojure
:repl-options {:init-ns my-project.core
               :prompt (fn [ns] (str "my-repl[" ns "]=> "))}
```

### Starting a REPL Session with Boot

Boot is another build tool for Clojure, offering a more flexible and composable approach compared to Leiningen. To start a REPL session with Boot, use the following command:

```bash
boot repl
```

Boot's REPL integrates seamlessly with its task-based architecture, allowing you to dynamically modify the build pipeline and environment.

#### Configuring Boot REPL

Boot's configuration is defined in the `build.boot` file, which uses Clojure syntax for maximum flexibility. Key configuration aspects include:

- **Dependencies:** Use the `set-env!` function to specify dependencies and source paths.

```clojure
(set-env!
  :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                  [compojure "1.6.2"]])
```

- **Tasks and Pipelines:** Boot's task-based model allows you to compose tasks that modify the REPL environment. For example, you can create a task to load specific namespaces or set environment variables.

```clojure
(deftask dev
  "Start a development REPL"
  []
  (comp
    (watch)
    (repl :init-ns 'my-project.core)))
```

### Differences Between Leiningen and Boot REPLs

While both Leiningen and Boot provide robust REPL environments, they differ in their approach and capabilities:

- **Configuration:** Leiningen uses a declarative `project.clj` file, while Boot employs a more flexible, code-driven `build.boot` file.

- **Task Composition:** Boot's task-based architecture allows for dynamic modification of the build pipeline, offering greater flexibility for complex workflows.

- **Profiles vs. Tasks:** Leiningen's profiles provide a straightforward way to manage environment-specific settings, whereas Boot's tasks offer more granular control over the build process.

### Loading Project Namespaces and Accessing Code

Both Leiningen and Boot REPLs allow you to interact with your project's codebase, facilitating rapid development and testing. To load project namespaces:

- **Leiningen:** Use the `:init-ns` option in `project.clj` to specify the default namespace loaded at REPL startup. Alternatively, manually require namespaces using `(require '[my-project.core :as core])`.

- **Boot:** Specify the `:init-ns` option in the `repl` task or manually require namespaces as needed.

### Customizing the REPL Environment

Customizing the REPL environment can significantly enhance usability and productivity. Consider the following tips:

- **Custom Prompts:** Define a custom prompt function to display relevant information, such as the current namespace or project version.

- **Preloaded Code:** Use initialization options to preload frequently used functions or macros, reducing repetitive code entry.

- **REPL Middleware:** Explore REPL middleware options to extend functionality, such as integrating with debugging tools or enhancing code completion.

### Practical Code Examples

Let's explore some practical examples to illustrate these concepts:

#### Example 1: Leiningen REPL with Custom Prompt

```clojure
(defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]]
  :repl-options {:init-ns my-project.core
                 :prompt (fn [ns] (str "my-repl[" ns "]=> "))})
```

#### Example 2: Boot REPL with Development Task

```clojure
(set-env!
  :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                  [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]])

(deftask dev
  "Start a development REPL with auto-reloading"
  []
  (comp
    (watch)
    (repl :init-ns 'my-project.core)))
```

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Classpath Management:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified to avoid runtime errors.

- **Namespace Conflicts:** Be mindful of namespace conflicts, especially when using multiple libraries with overlapping names.

- **Performance Optimization:** Use REPL middleware judiciously to avoid performance degradation.

### Conclusion

Mastering the REPL with Leiningen and Boot is a vital skill for Clojure developers, enabling efficient and interactive development. By understanding the nuances of each tool, configuring environments effectively, and leveraging customization options, you can significantly enhance your Clojure development workflow.
