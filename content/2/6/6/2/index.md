## 6.6.2 Integrating Boot with Other Tools

Boot, a powerful build automation tool for Clojure, offers a flexible and extensible platform for integrating with a variety of tools and technologies. In this section, we will explore how Boot can be used to integrate with ClojureScript, Docker, and manage polyglot builds involving Java or other JVM languages. By understanding these integrations, you can enhance your development workflow and accommodate diverse project requirements.

### Integrating Boot with ClojureScript

ClojureScript, a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript, is a popular choice for building modern web applications. Boot provides excellent support for ClojureScript, enabling seamless integration into your build process.

#### Setting Up a ClojureScript Project with Boot

To get started with ClojureScript in a Boot project, you need to include the necessary dependencies and configure the build pipeline. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Update your `build.boot` file to include the ClojureScript dependency.

   ```clojure
   (set-env!
     :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojurescript "1.10.844"]
                     [adzerk/boot-cljs "2.1.5"]])
   ```

2. **Configure Build Pipeline**: Define a Boot task to compile ClojureScript.

   ```clojure
   (require '[adzerk.boot-cljs :refer [cljs]])

   (deftask build-cljs
     "Compile ClojureScript"
     []
     (comp
       (cljs :source-map true
             :optimizations :advanced
             :output-to "target/main.js")))
   ```

3. **Run the Build**: Execute the task to compile your ClojureScript code.

   ```shell
   boot build-cljs
   ```

This setup compiles your ClojureScript code into a single JavaScript file, ready for use in your web application.

#### Integrating Frontend Build Processes

Boot's flexibility allows you to integrate other frontend build processes, such as bundling and minification, using additional tasks or plugins. For example, you can use the `boot-cljs-repl` plugin for live reloading during development:

```clojure
(set-env!
  :dependencies '[[adzerk/boot-cljs-repl "0.3.3"]
                  [weasel "0.7.0"]])

(require '[adzerk.boot-cljs-repl :refer [cljs-repl start-repl]])

(deftask dev
  "Start development environment with live reloading"
  []
  (comp
    (watch)
    (cljs-repl)
    (start-repl)
    (cljs :source-map true)
    (target :dir #{"target"})))
```

Running `boot dev` starts a development server with live reloading, enhancing your development experience.

### Integrating Boot with Docker

Docker is a widely used platform for containerizing applications, providing a consistent environment for development and deployment. Boot can be integrated with Docker to streamline the build and deployment process.

#### Building Docker Images with Boot

To build a Docker image using Boot, you can define a task that executes Docker commands. Here's an example of how to build a Docker image for a Clojure application:

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: Define the Dockerfile for your application.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM clojure:openjdk-11-lein
   COPY target/ /app/
   WORKDIR /app
   CMD ["java", "-jar", "your-app.jar"]
   ```

2. **Define a Boot Task**: Create a Boot task to build the Docker image.

   ```clojure
   (deftask docker-build
     "Build Docker image"
     []
     (comp
       (sift :include #{#"target/.*"})
       (target :dir #{"docker-build"})
       (shell "docker build -t your-app:latest docker-build")))
   ```

3. **Execute the Task**: Run the task to build the Docker image.

   ```shell
   boot docker-build
   ```

This task copies the compiled application into a Docker image, ready for deployment.

#### Running Docker Containers with Boot

You can also define tasks to run Docker containers, facilitating local development and testing. Here's an example:

```clojure
(deftask docker-run
  "Run Docker container"
  []
  (shell "docker run -p 8080:8080 your-app:latest"))
```

Running `boot docker-run` starts the Docker container, exposing the application on port 8080.

### Managing Polyglot Builds with Boot

In modern software development, it's common to use multiple languages and technologies within a single project. Boot's extensibility makes it an excellent choice for managing polyglot builds involving Java, Scala, or other JVM languages.

#### Integrating Java Code with Boot

Boot can easily integrate Java code into your build process. Here's how you can compile and package Java code alongside Clojure:

1. **Add Java Source Path**: Update your `build.boot` file to include the Java source path.

   ```clojure
   (set-env!
     :source-paths #{"src/clj" "src/java"}
     :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]])
   ```

2. **Compile Java Code**: Use the `javac` task to compile Java code.

   ```clojure
   (require '[boot.task.built-in :refer [javac]])

   (deftask compile-java
     "Compile Java code"
     []
     (javac :source-paths #{"src/java"}))
   ```

3. **Package the Application**: Combine Java and Clojure code into a single JAR file.

   ```clojure
   (deftask build
     "Build the application"
     []
     (comp
       (compile-java)
       (uber)
       (jar :main 'your.main.namespace)))
   ```

4. **Run the Build**: Execute the task to build the application.

   ```shell
   boot build
   ```

This setup compiles Java and Clojure code, packaging them into a single executable JAR file.

#### Integrating with Other JVM Languages

Boot's flexibility extends to other JVM languages, such as Scala or Kotlin. By configuring the appropriate source paths and dependencies, you can manage builds involving multiple languages.

For example, to integrate Scala, you can add the Scala compiler and runtime as dependencies and configure the build pipeline accordingly.

### Flexibility of Boot in Diverse Project Requirements

Boot's pipeline architecture and extensibility make it an ideal choice for projects with diverse requirements. Whether you're building a web application with ClojureScript, containerizing your application with Docker, or managing a polyglot codebase, Boot provides the tools and flexibility to streamline your workflow.

#### Custom Pipelines and Tasks

Boot allows you to define custom pipelines and tasks tailored to your project's needs. By composing tasks, you can create complex build processes that automate various aspects of your development workflow.

Here's an example of a custom pipeline that combines multiple tasks:

```clojure
(deftask full-build
  "Full build pipeline"
  []
  (comp
    (clean)
    (compile-java)
    (build-cljs)
    (docker-build)))
```

Running `boot full-build` executes the entire build pipeline, from cleaning the workspace to building Docker images.

#### Best Practices for Boot Integration

- **Modularize Tasks**: Break down your build process into modular tasks that can be composed as needed.
- **Leverage Plugins**: Use existing Boot plugins to extend functionality and avoid reinventing the wheel.
- **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Define tasks for repetitive actions, such as running tests or deploying to staging environments.

### Conclusion

Integrating Boot with other tools and technologies enhances your development workflow, providing a flexible and powerful platform for building modern applications. By leveraging Boot's capabilities, you can streamline the integration of ClojureScript, Docker, and polyglot builds, accommodating diverse project requirements with ease.
