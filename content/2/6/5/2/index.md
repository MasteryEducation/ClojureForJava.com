## 6.5.2 Creating and Running Tasks with Boot in Clojure

In the world of Clojure development, Boot stands out as a versatile and powerful build automation tool. Unlike traditional build tools, Boot offers a flexible, pipeline-based approach to project management and task execution. This section will guide you through the process of installing Boot, setting up a basic project, and creating and running tasks using the `build.boot` file. We will also explore task options, middleware, and common tasks like `compile`, `pom`, and `jar`.

### Installing Boot and Setting Up a Basic Project

Before diving into task creation, let's start by installing Boot and setting up a basic project. Boot requires Java to be installed on your system, so ensure you have a compatible version of Java (Java 8 or later) installed.

#### Step 1: Install Boot

Boot can be installed using a simple shell script. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/boot-clj/boot-bin/releases/download/latest/boot.sh -o boot && chmod 755 boot && sudo mv boot /usr/local/bin/
```

This command downloads the Boot script, makes it executable, and moves it to a directory in your system's PATH.

#### Step 2: Verify the Installation

To verify that Boot is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
boot -V
```

You should see the Boot version number, confirming the installation was successful.

#### Step 3: Create a Basic Project

With Boot installed, you can create a new Clojure project. Navigate to your desired directory and run:

```bash
boot -d boot/new new -t app -n my-boot-project
```

This command uses the `boot/new` task to generate a new application project with the name `my-boot-project`. The project structure will include a `build.boot` file, which is the heart of Boot's configuration.

### Defining and Running Tasks Using the `build.boot` File

The `build.boot` file is where you define tasks, dependencies, and other configurations for your project. Let's explore how to define and run tasks.

#### Understanding the `build.boot` File

A typical `build.boot` file might look like this:

```clojure
(set-env!
 :source-paths #{"src"}
 :resource-paths #{"resources"}
 :dependencies '[[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]])

(deftask build
  "Build the project."
  []
  (comp
    (aot)
    (uber)
    (jar :main 'my-boot-project.core)))
```

- **`set-env!`**: Configures the environment, specifying source paths, resource paths, and dependencies.
- **`deftask`**: Defines a new task. In this example, the `build` task compiles the project, creates an uberjar, and packages it into a JAR file.

#### Running Tasks

To run a task, use the Boot command followed by the task name:

```bash
boot build
```

This command executes the `build` task, performing the actions defined within it.

### Task Options and Middleware

Boot tasks can be customized with options and middleware, providing flexibility and control over task execution.

#### Task Options

Task options allow you to parameterize tasks. Here's an example of a task with options:

```clojure
(deftask greet
  "Greet the user."
  [n name NAME str "The name of the person to greet."]
  (with-pass-thru _
    (println "Hello," name "!")))
```

- **`[n name NAME str "The name of the person to greet."]`**: Defines an option `-n` or `--name` that accepts a string value.

To run the `greet` task with a specific name, use:

```bash
boot greet -n "Alice"
```

#### Middleware

Middleware in Boot allows you to modify the behavior of tasks by wrapping them with additional functionality. Middleware can be used for logging, error handling, or modifying task inputs and outputs.

Here's an example of a simple logging middleware:

```clojure
(defn log-middleware [task]
  (fn [next-task]
    (fn [fileset]
      (println "Running task...")
      (let [result (next-task fileset)]
        (println "Task completed.")
        result))))

(deftask example
  "An example task with logging."
  []
  (log-middleware
    (fn [fileset]
      (println "Task logic here.")
      fileset)))
```

In this example, `log-middleware` wraps the task logic, printing messages before and after the task execution.

### Common Tasks: `compile`, `pom`, and `jar`

Boot provides a variety of built-in tasks for common build operations. Let's explore some of these tasks.

#### The `compile` Task

The `compile` task compiles Clojure source files into Java bytecode. It is often used in conjunction with other tasks like `jar` or `uber`.

```clojure
(deftask compile
  "Compile Clojure source files."
  []
  (comp
    (aot)
    (jar)))
```

#### The `pom` Task

The `pom` task generates a Maven POM file, which is useful for projects that need to be published to Maven repositories.

```clojure
(deftask pom
  "Generate a POM file."
  []
  (pom :project 'my-boot-project
       :version "0.1.0"
       :description "A sample Boot project"))
```

#### The `jar` Task

The `jar` task packages compiled classes and resources into a JAR file. It can be combined with other tasks to create an executable JAR.

```clojure
(deftask jar
  "Package the project into a JAR."
  []
  (comp
    (aot)
    (jar :main 'my-boot-project.core)))
```

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- **Keep Tasks Modular**: Define tasks for specific purposes and compose them using `comp`. This promotes reusability and maintainability.
- **Use Middleware Wisely**: Middleware can add powerful functionality but can also introduce complexity. Use it judiciously to avoid overcomplicating task logic.
- **Leverage Task Options**: Parameterize tasks with options to make them flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.
- **Optimize for Performance**: Profile and optimize tasks that involve heavy computation or I/O operations to ensure efficient execution.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Misconfigured Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are specified in `set-env!` to avoid runtime errors.
- **Task Composition Errors**: When composing tasks, ensure they are compatible and correctly ordered to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Overuse of Middleware**: Excessive use of middleware can make tasks difficult to understand and debug. Keep middleware simple and focused.

### Conclusion

Boot's unique approach to build automation offers a powerful toolset for Clojure developers. By mastering task creation, options, and middleware, you can streamline your development workflow and build robust, efficient applications. Whether you're compiling code, generating POM files, or packaging JARs, Boot provides the flexibility and control needed to manage complex projects.
