## 1.5 Setting Up the Clojure Development Environment

Setting up a Clojure development environment is a crucial first step for Java developers transitioning to functional programming. This section will guide you through installing Clojure on different operating systems, introduce popular development tools, and explain how to manage projects using Leiningen and deps.edn. Finally, we'll walk through starting your first REPL session to run simple expressions.

### Installing Clojure

Clojure is a JVM language, which means it runs on the Java Virtual Machine. This allows you to leverage your existing Java knowledge and infrastructure. Let's explore how to install Clojure on various operating systems.

#### Installing Clojure on Windows

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

2. **Install Clojure CLI Tools**: Download and run the Windows installer from the [Clojure website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started). This will set up the Clojure CLI tools and add them to your system PATH.

3. **Verify Installation**: Open a command prompt and run:
   ```shell
   clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
   ```
   You should see the message "Clojure installed successfully!" confirming the installation.

#### Installing Clojure on macOS

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't already, install Homebrew by following the instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

2. **Install Clojure**: Use Homebrew to install Clojure:
   ```shell
   brew install clojure/tools/clojure
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**: Open Terminal and run:
   ```shell
   clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
   ```
   You should see the confirmation message.

#### Installing Clojure on Linux

1. **Install Java**: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher. You can install it using your package manager, for example:
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

2. **Install Clojure CLI Tools**: Follow the instructions on the [Clojure website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) to download and install the CLI tools.

3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal and run:
   ```shell
   clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
   ```
   You should see the success message.

### Development Tools

Choosing the right development tools can enhance your productivity and make coding in Clojure more enjoyable. Here are some popular editors and IDEs for Clojure development.

#### Cursive for IntelliJ IDEA

[Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) is a powerful Clojure plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and REPL integration. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**: Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

2. **Install Cursive Plugin**: Open IntelliJ IDEA, go to `File > Settings > Plugins`, search for "Cursive", and install it.

3. **Create a Clojure Project**: Use the `File > New > Project` menu to create a new Clojure project. Cursive will guide you through setting up Leiningen or deps.edn for project management.

#### Emacs with CIDER

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a highly customizable text editor, and [CIDER](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/) is a Clojure Interactive Development Environment that integrates with Emacs.

1. **Install Emacs**: Download and install Emacs from [GNU's website](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html).

2. **Install CIDER**: Add the following to your Emacs configuration file (`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`):
   ```elisp
   (require 'package)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
   (package-initialize)
   (unless (package-installed-p 'cider)
     (package-refresh-contents)
     (package-install 'cider))
   ```

3. **Start a Clojure REPL**: Open a Clojure file and use `M-x cider-jack-in` to start a REPL session.

### Leiningen and deps.edn

Clojure projects are typically managed using either Leiningen or the Clojure CLI tools with deps.edn. Both tools have their strengths, and your choice may depend on your project's needs.

#### Leiningen

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is a popular build automation tool for Clojure, similar to Maven for Java. It simplifies project setup, dependency management, and running tasks.

1. **Install Leiningen**: Follow the instructions on the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/) to download and install it.

2. **Create a New Project**: Run the following command to create a new project:
   ```shell
   lein new app my-clojure-app
   ```

3. **Run the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and start the REPL:
   ```shell
   cd my-clojure-app
   lein repl
   ```

4. **Project Structure**: Leiningen projects have a `project.clj` file for configuration, similar to a `pom.xml` in Maven.

#### deps.edn and Clojure CLI

The Clojure CLI tools use a `deps.edn` file for dependency management, offering a more lightweight and flexible approach.

1. **Create a deps.edn File**: In your project directory, create a `deps.edn` file with the following content:
   ```clojure
   {:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}}
   ```

2. **Run the REPL**: Use the Clojure CLI to start a REPL:
   ```shell
   clj
   ```

3. **Add Dependencies**: Update the `deps.edn` file to include additional libraries as needed.

### First REPL Session

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is a powerful tool for interactive development in Clojure. It allows you to evaluate expressions, test code snippets, and explore libraries in real-time.

1. **Start the REPL**: Use either Leiningen or the Clojure CLI to start a REPL session.

2. **Run Simple Expressions**: Try running some basic Clojure expressions:
   ```clojure
   ;; Define a simple function
   (defn greet [name]
     (str "Hello, " name "!"))

   ;; Call the function
   (greet "World")
   ```

3. **Experiment with Data Structures**: Explore Clojure's immutable data structures:
   ```clojure
   ;; Create a vector
   (def my-vector [1 2 3 4 5])

   ;; Access elements
   (nth my-vector 2) ; => 3

   ;; Add an element
   (conj my-vector 6) ; => [1 2 3 4 5 6]
   ```

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data and the structure of Clojure projects, let's look at a few diagrams.

#### Clojure Project Structure

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Project Root] --> B[src]
    A --> C[test]
    A --> D[resources]
    A --> E[project.clj or deps.edn]
    B --> F[my_clojure_app/core.clj]
    C --> G[my_clojure_app/core_test.clj]
```

#### Data Flow in a Clojure Function

```mermaid

    A[Input Data] --> B[Function 1]
    B --> C[Function 2]
    C --> D[Output Data]
```
