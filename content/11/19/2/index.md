## 19.2 Refactoring Loops into Recursions

As experienced Java developers, you're likely accustomed to using loops such as `for` and `while` to iterate over collections and perform repetitive tasks. In Clojure, a functional programming language, recursion and higher-order functions replace these traditional looping constructs. This transformation not only aligns with functional programming paradigms but also leverages Clojure's strengths in handling immutable data and concurrency.

### From Loops to Recursion

#### Understanding the Transition

In Java, loops are a fundamental construct for iteration. Consider a simple `for` loop that sums an array of integers:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}
System.out.println(sum); // Outputs: 15
```

In Clojure, we achieve the same result using recursion or higher-order functions, eliminating the need for explicit loop constructs and mutable state.

#### Recursive Approach

Recursion in Clojure involves defining a function that calls itself with modified arguments until a base condition is met. Here's how we can refactor the above Java loop into a recursive Clojure function:

```clojure
(defn sum-recursive [numbers]
  (letfn [(sum-helper [nums acc]
            (if (empty? nums)
              acc
              (recur (rest nums) (+ acc (first nums)))))]
    (sum-helper numbers 0)))

(println (sum-recursive [1 2 3 4 5])) ; Outputs: 15
```

**Explanation:**
- **Base Case**: The recursion stops when the list is empty.
- **Recursive Step**: The function calls itself with the rest of the list and the accumulated sum.

### Using `reduce` and `fold`

Clojure provides powerful higher-order functions like `reduce` that abstract away the recursion, making the code more concise and expressive.

#### Using `reduce`

The `reduce` function processes each element of a collection, accumulating a result. Here's how we can use `reduce` to sum the numbers:

```clojure
(defn sum-reduce [numbers]
  (reduce + 0 numbers))

(println (sum-reduce [1 2 3 4 5])) ; Outputs: 15
```

**Explanation:**
- **Initial Value**: `0` is the starting value for the accumulation.
- **Function**: `+` is applied to each element and the accumulated result.

#### Eliminating Index Variables

In Java, loops often rely on index variables to access elements. In Clojure, sequence abstractions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` eliminate the need for explicit indexing, leading to cleaner code.

Consider a Java loop that filters even numbers:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
List<Integer> evens = new ArrayList<>();
for (int number : numbers) {
    if (number % 2 == 0) {
        evens.add(number);
    }
}
System.out.println(evens); // Outputs: [2, 4]
```

In Clojure, we use `filter`:

```clojure
(defn filter-evens [numbers]
  (filter even? numbers))

(println (filter-evens [1 2 3 4 5])) ; Outputs: (2 4)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Predicate Function**: `even?` checks if a number is even.
- **Sequence Abstraction**: `filter` processes each element without explicit indexing.

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Factorial Calculation

Let's refactor a Java loop for calculating factorial into a recursive Clojure function.

**Java Loop:**

```java
int factorial(int n) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Clojure Recursion:**

```clojure
(defn factorial [n]
  (letfn [(fact-helper [n acc]
            (if (zero? n)
              acc
              (recur (dec n) (* acc n))))]
    (fact-helper n 1)))

(println (factorial 5)) ; Outputs: 120
```

**Explanation:**
- **Base Case**: When `n` is zero, return the accumulated result.
- **Recursive Step**: Multiply the accumulator by `n` and decrement `n`.

#### Example 2: Fibonacci Sequence

Refactor a Java loop for generating Fibonacci numbers into a recursive Clojure function.

**Java Loop:**

```java
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int prev = 0, curr = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int next = prev + curr;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    return curr;
}
```

**Clojure Recursion:**

```clojure
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (letfn [(fib-helper [a b count]
            (if (zero? count)
              a
              (recur b (+ a b) (dec count))))]
    (fib-helper 0 1 n)))

(println (fibonacci 5)) ; Outputs: 5
```

**Explanation:**
- **Base Case**: When `count` is zero, return the first number.
- **Recursive Step**: Calculate the next Fibonacci number and decrement the count.

Experiment with the provided examples by modifying the base cases or recursive steps. For instance, try changing the initial values or conditions in the `factorial` and `fibonacci` functions to see how the output changes.
