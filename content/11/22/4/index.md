## 22.4 Database Interaction with `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc`

As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for interacting with relational databases. In Clojure, we have two primary libraries for database interaction: `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc`. This section will guide you through using these libraries to connect to databases, manage connections, and handle data efficiently in a functional programming context.

### Database Connectivity

Clojure's approach to database connectivity leverages the JVM's capabilities, allowing seamless integration with existing Java libraries and tools. This means you can use familiar concepts like JDBC while benefiting from Clojure's functional paradigms.

#### `clojure.java.jdbc`

`clojure.java.jdbc` is a mature library that provides a straightforward API for database operations. It abstracts the complexity of JDBC while allowing you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with ease.

**Key Features:**

- **Simplicity**: Offers a simple API for executing SQL queries.
- **Flexibility**: Supports various SQL databases through JDBC drivers.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with existing Java applications.

**Basic Usage:**

To get started with `clojure.java.jdbc`, you need to include it in your project dependencies. Here's a basic setup using Leiningen:

```clojure
(defproject my-database-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
                 [mysql/mysql-connector-java "8.0.26"]])
```

**Connecting to a Database:**

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec {:dbtype "mysql"
              :dbname "my_database"
              :host "localhost"
              :user "root"
              :password "password"})

;; Querying the database
(jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

In this example, we define a `db-spec` map containing the database connection details. The `jdbc/query` function executes a SQL query and returns the results as a sequence of maps, where each map represents a row.

**Handling Transactions:**

Transactions in `clojure.java.jdbc` are managed using the `jdbc/with-db-transaction` macro, which ensures that all operations within the block are executed atomically.

```clojure
(jdbc/with-db-transaction [t-con db-spec]
  (jdbc/insert! t-con :users {:name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com"})
  (jdbc/update! t-con :users {:email "alice@newdomain.com"} ["name=?" "Alice"]))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to insert and update records within a transaction, ensuring data consistency.

#### Introducing `next.jdbc`

`next.jdbc` is a modern alternative to `clojure.java.jdbc`, designed for better performance and a more intuitive API. It is built on top of the same JDBC foundation but offers enhancements that make it more suitable for contemporary applications.

**Key Features:**

- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Simplicity**: Provides a cleaner, more consistent API.
- **Flexibility**: Supports advanced data handling and mapping.

**Basic Usage:**

To use `next.jdbc`, include it in your project dependencies:

```clojure
(defproject my-database-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc "1.2.780"]
                 [mysql/mysql-connector-java "8.0.26"]])
```

**Connecting to a Database:**

```clojure
(require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec {:dbtype "mysql"
              :dbname "my_database"
              :host "localhost"
              :user "root"
              :password "password"})

;; Creating a datasource
(def ds (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec))

;; Querying the database
(jdbc/execute! ds ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

In `next.jdbc`, we create a datasource using `jdbc/get-datasource`, which is then used for executing queries. The `jdbc/execute!` function returns the results as a vector of maps.

**Handling Transactions:**

Transactions in `next.jdbc` are handled using the `jdbc/with-transaction` macro, similar to `clojure.java.jdbc`.

```clojure
(jdbc/with-transaction [tx ds]
  (jdbc/execute! tx ["INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)" "Alice" "alice@example.com"])
  (jdbc/execute! tx ["UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE name = ?" "alice@newdomain.com" "Alice"]))
```

This example shows how to perform multiple operations within a transaction, ensuring atomicity.

### Connection Management

Efficient connection management is crucial for database-driven applications. Both `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc` support connection pooling, which can significantly improve performance by reusing existing connections.

**Using HikariCP for Connection Pooling:**

HikariCP is a popular JDBC connection pool library known for its high performance and reliability. You can integrate it with both `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc`.

**Setting Up HikariCP:**

Add HikariCP to your project dependencies:

```clojure
(defproject my-database-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [com.zaxxer/HikariCP "5.0.1"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
                 [com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc "1.2.780"]
                 [mysql/mysql-connector-java "8.0.26"]])
```

**Configuring HikariCP:**

```clojure
(require '[com.zaxxer.hikari :refer [HikariDataSource]])

(def hikari-cp-config
  {:jdbc-url "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database"
   :username "root"
   :password "password"
   :maximum-pool-size 10})

(def ds (HikariDataSource. hikari-cp-config))
```

In this setup, we define a configuration map for HikariCP and create a `HikariDataSource` instance. This datasource can be used with both `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc`.

**Using HikariCP with `clojure.java.jdbc`:**

```clojure
(jdbc/query ds ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

**Using HikariCP with `next.jdbc`:**

```clojure
(jdbc/execute! ds ["SELECT * FROM users"])
```

### Working with Data

Handling data efficiently is a core aspect of database interaction. Both `clojure.java.jdbc` and `next.jdbc` provide mechanisms for querying data, handling transactions, and mapping results to Clojure data structures.

**Querying Data:**

In both libraries, querying data involves executing SQL statements and processing the results as Clojure data structures.

**Example with `clojure.java.jdbc`:**

```clojure
(defn get-users []
  (jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM users"]))
```

**Example with `next.jdbc`:**

```clojure
(defn get-users []
  (jdbc/execute! ds ["SELECT * FROM users"]))
```

**Handling Transactions:**

Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity. Both libraries provide macros for managing transactions, allowing you to execute multiple operations atomically.

**Mapping Results to Clojure Data Structures:**

Both libraries return query results as sequences or vectors of maps, where each map represents a row. This makes it easy to work with the data in a functional style.

**Example:**

```clojure
(defn print-user-names []
  (let [users (jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM users"])]
    (doseq [user users]
      (println (:name user)))))
```

This example demonstrates how to iterate over query results and print user names.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data and operations, let's visualize the process of querying a database and handling transactions using `next.jdbc`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Clojure Application
    participant D as Database
    C->>D: Connect to Database
    C->>D: Execute Query
    D-->>C: Return Results
    C->>D: Begin Transaction
    C->>D: Execute Insert/Update
    C->>D: Commit Transaction
    D-->>C: Acknowledge Commit
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Connect to Database**: The application establishes a connection to the database.
- **Execute Query**: A SQL query is executed, and results are returned.
- **Begin Transaction**: A transaction is started for multiple operations.
- **Execute Insert/Update**: Data is inserted or updated within the transaction.
- **Commit Transaction**: The transaction is committed, ensuring data consistency.
