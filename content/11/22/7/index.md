## 22.7 Testing Tools and Libraries

In the world of software development, testing is a cornerstone for ensuring code quality and reliability. As experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, you may already be familiar with testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG. Clojure offers its own set of powerful testing tools and libraries that align with the functional programming paradigm, allowing you to write robust, maintainable tests. In this section, we will explore these tools, including `clojure.test`, Midje, and `test.check`, and discuss how to integrate them into your development workflow.

### Testing Overview

Testing is crucial in any programming language, but it takes on a unique flavor in functional programming. Clojure's emphasis on immutability and pure functions makes it particularly amenable to testing. Pure functions, which always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects, are inherently easier to test. This section will guide you through the available testing tools in Clojure, helping you leverage them to ensure your applications are both reliable and maintainable.

### `clojure.test`: The Built-in Testing Framework

Clojure comes with a built-in testing framework called `clojure.test`. It is straightforward, integrates well with the language, and provides the basic functionality needed to write and run unit tests.

#### Writing and Running Unit Tests with `clojure.test`

To get started with `clojure.test`, you need to require it in your namespace and define test functions using the `deftest` macro. Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.core :refer :all]))

(deftest test-addition
  (testing "Addition of two numbers"
    (is (= 4 (add 2 2)))
    (is (= 5 (add 2 3)))))
```

In this example, we define a test namespace `myapp.core-test` and require both `clojure.test` and the namespace we want to test, `myapp.core`. The `deftest` macro is used to define a test function, and `testing` provides a description for the test. The `is` macro checks if the expression evaluates to true.

To run the tests, you can use the `run-tests` function:

```clojure
(run-tests 'myapp.core-test)
```

This will execute all the tests in the specified namespace and report the results.

#### Comparing with Java's JUnit

In Java, you might use JUnit to write tests, which involves annotations like `@Test` and assertions such as `assertEquals`. Clojure's `clojure.test` provides similar functionality but in a more concise and expressive manner, thanks to Clojure's macro system.

### Behavior-Driven Development with Midje

For those who prefer a behavior-driven development (BDD) approach, Midje is a popular choice in the Clojure ecosystem. Midje allows you to write tests that are more readable and resemble specifications.

#### Introducing Midje

Midje provides a syntax that is more narrative and expressive, making it easier to understand the intent of the tests. Here's an example of a Midje test:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [midje.sweet :refer :all]
            [myapp.core :refer :all]))

(fact "Adding two numbers"
  (add 2 2) => 4
  (add 2 3) => 5)
```

In this example, the `fact` macro is used to define a test, and the `=>` operator is used to express the expected outcome. This syntax is more intuitive and aligns with the BDD philosophy of writing tests as specifications.

#### Advantages of Midje

- **Readability**: Midje tests are often more readable and closer to natural language.
- **Expressiveness**: The syntax allows for more expressive tests, making it easier to capture complex behaviors.
- **Integration**: Midje integrates well with Clojure's REPL, allowing for interactive development and testing.

### Property-Based Testing with `test.check`

Property-based testing is a powerful technique that involves specifying properties that should hold true for a wide range of inputs, rather than writing individual test cases. Clojure's `test.check` library provides tools for property-based testing.

#### Benefits of Property-Based Testing

- **Comprehensive Testing**: By testing a wide range of inputs, property-based testing can uncover edge cases that traditional unit tests might miss.
- **Specification-Driven**: Tests are based on properties or specifications, making them more robust and less prone to changes in implementation.

#### Implementing Property-Based Testing with `test.check`

Here's a simple example of using `test.check` to test a property of an addition function:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [clojure.test.check :as tc]
            [clojure.test.check.generators :as gen]
            [clojure.test.check.properties :as prop]))

(def addition-commutative
  (prop/for-all [a gen/int
                 b gen/int]
    (= (add a b) (add b a))))

(tc/quick-check 1000 addition-commutative)
```

In this example, we define a property `addition-commutative` that checks if the addition function is commutative. The `prop/for-all` macro generates random integers and tests the property for each pair. The `quick-check` function runs the property test a specified number of times (1000 in this case).

### Mocking and Stubbing

In testing, mocking and stubbing are techniques used to simulate the behavior of complex objects or systems. Clojure provides several libraries to facilitate mocking and stubbing.

#### Techniques and Libraries for Mocking

- **`with-redefs`**: A built-in Clojure function that temporarily redefines vars for testing purposes.
- **Mocking Libraries**: Libraries like `clojure.test.mock` and `mockery` provide more advanced mocking capabilities.

Here's an example using `with-redefs`:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.core :refer :all]))

(deftest test-with-mocking
  (with-redefs [external-service (fn [_] "mocked response")]
    (is (= "mocked response" (call-external-service "input")))))
```

In this example, `with-redefs` is used to temporarily redefine `external-service` to return a mocked response during the test.

### Continuous Testing

Continuous testing is the practice of running tests automatically as part of the development process, often integrated into continuous integration (CI) pipelines. This ensures that code changes do not introduce regressions and that the application remains stable.

#### Integrating Testing into CI Pipelines

- **Automated Testing**: Use tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate the running of tests.
- **Feedback Loop**: Continuous testing provides immediate feedback to developers, allowing them to address issues quickly.

Here's a simple example of a GitHub Actions workflow for running Clojure tests:

```yaml
name: Clojure CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: '11'
    - name: Run tests
      run: lein test
```

This workflow runs tests using Leiningen whenever code is pushed or a pull request is opened.
