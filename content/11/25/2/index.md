### Code Examples and Exercises

To reinforce your learning, it's essential to practice writing Clojure code and solving problems. Here are some exercises and challenges to try:

#### Exercise 1: Implement a Simple Function

Write a Clojure function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number doubled. Compare this with a similar implementation in Java.

```clojure
;; Clojure implementation
(defn double-numbers [numbers]
  (map #(* 2 %) numbers))

;; Usage
(double-numbers [1 2 3 4 5]) ;; => (2 4 6 8 10)
```

```java
// Java implementation
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class DoubleNumbers {
    public static List<Integer> doubleNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
        return numbers.stream()
                      .map(n -> n * 2)
                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

#### Exercise 2: Create a Higher-Order Function

Write a higher-order function in Clojure that takes a function and a list, and applies the function to each element of the list.

```clojure
;; Clojure implementation
(defn apply-function [f lst]
  (map f lst))

;; Usage
(apply-function inc [1 2 3 4 5]) ;; => (2 3 4 5 6)
```

#### Exercise 3: Implement a Recursive Function

Write a recursive function in Clojure that calculates the factorial of a given number.

```clojure
;; Clojure implementation
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))

;; Usage
(factorial 5) ;; => 120
```

### Visual Aids

To enhance your understanding of Clojure concepts, here are some visual aids:

#### Diagram 1: Data Flow in Higher-Order Functions

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Data] --> B[Higher-Order Function];
    B --> C[Transformed Data];
    C --> D[Output];
```

*Caption: This diagram illustrates the flow of data through a higher-order function, transforming input data into output.*

#### Diagram 2: Immutability and Persistent Data Structures

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Data] --> B[Immutable Data Structure];
    B --> C[New Version];
    B --> D[Old Version];
```

*Caption: This diagram shows how immutable data structures create new versions of data without modifying the original.*
