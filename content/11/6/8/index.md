## 6.8 Practical Examples Using Transducers

Transducers in Clojure offer a powerful and flexible way to perform data transformations. They allow you to compose processing steps without creating intermediate collections, which can lead to more efficient and cleaner code. In this section, we will explore practical examples of using transducers for common data transformation tasks, processing collections, and integrating with Clojure's core functions.

### Understanding Transducers

Before diving into examples, let's briefly recap what transducers are. Transducers are composable and reusable transformation functions that can be applied to different types of data sources. Unlike traditional sequence operations that are tied to specific data structures, transducers abstract the transformation process, allowing you to apply them to lists, vectors, maps, and even channels.

#### Key Concepts

- **Composability**: Transducers can be composed together to form complex transformations.
- **Efficiency**: They avoid creating intermediate collections, reducing memory overhead.
- **Reusability**: Transducers can be applied to various data sources, enhancing code reuse.

### Data Transformation Tasks

Let's explore some practical examples where transducers can be applied to common data transformation tasks.

#### Example 1: Filtering and Mapping

Suppose you have a collection of numbers, and you want to filter out even numbers and then square the remaining numbers. Here's how you can achieve this using transducers:

```clojure
(def numbers [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])

(defn even? [n]
  (zero? (mod n 2)))

(defn square [n]
  (* n n))

(def xf (comp (filter even?) (map square)))

(into [] xf numbers)
;; => [4 16 36 64 100]
```

**Explanation**: 
- We define a transducer `xf` using `comp` to compose a filter and a map operation.
- The `filter` transducer removes even numbers, and the `map` transducer squares the numbers.
- `into` applies the transducer to the `numbers` collection, producing the final result.

#### Example 2: Reducing with Transducers

Transducers can also be used with reducing functions. Let's calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers:

```clojure
(def xf (comp (filter odd?) (map square)))

(transduce xf + 0 numbers)
;; => 165
```

**Explanation**:
- We reuse the `xf` transducer, but this time we apply it using `transduce`, which combines transformation and reduction.
- The `+` function is used as the reducing function, starting with an initial value of `0`.

### Processing Collections

Transducers can be applied to various collections, including lists, vectors, and maps. Let's see how they work with different data structures.

#### Example 3: Processing Vectors

Vectors are a common data structure in Clojure. Here's how you can process a vector using transducers:

```clojure
(def data [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10])

(def xf (comp (filter even?) (map inc)))

(into [] xf data)
;; => [3 5 7 9 11]
```

**Explanation**:
- We define a transducer `xf` that filters even numbers and increments them.
- `into` applies the transducer to the vector `data`, resulting in a new vector.

#### Example 4: Processing Maps

Maps can also be processed using transducers. Suppose you have a map of products with prices, and you want to apply a discount to products priced above a certain amount:

```clojure
(def products {:apple 100 :banana 80 :cherry 120 :date 90})

(defn discount [price]
  (* price 0.9))

(def xf (comp (filter (fn [[_ price]] (> price 90)))
              (map (fn [[product price]] [product (discount price)]))))

(into {} xf products)
;; => {:apple 90.0, :cherry 108.0}
```

**Explanation**:
- We define a transducer `xf` that filters products with prices greater than 90 and applies a discount.
- `into` applies the transducer to the map `products`, resulting in a new map with discounted prices.

### Interoperability with Core Functions

Transducers integrate seamlessly with Clojure's core functions, allowing you to leverage existing functionality while benefiting from the efficiency of transducers.

#### Example 5: Using `sequence` with Transducers

The `sequence` function can be used to apply a transducer to a collection, producing a lazy sequence:

```clojure
(def xf (comp (filter odd?) (map inc)))

(sequence xf numbers)
;; => (2 4 6 8 10)
```

**Explanation**:
- We define a transducer `xf` that filters odd numbers and increments them.
- `sequence` applies the transducer lazily, producing a sequence that can be consumed as needed.

#### Example 6: Combining Transducers with `core.async`

Transducers can be used with `core.async` channels to process data streams efficiently. Here's an example of using transducers with channels:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

(def ch (async/chan 10 (comp (filter even?) (map inc))))

(async/go
  (doseq [n (range 10)]
    (async/>! ch n))
  (async/close! ch))

(async/<!! (async/into [] ch))
;; => [2 4 6 8 10]
```

**Explanation**:
- We create a channel `ch` with a transducer that filters even numbers and increments them.
- We use `async/go` to put numbers into the channel and close it.
- `async/into` collects the transformed numbers into a vector.
