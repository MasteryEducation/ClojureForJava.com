## 10.4 Multimethods and Dispatching

In the realm of functional programming, Clojure provides a powerful mechanism for achieving polymorphic behavior through multimethods. Unlike traditional object-oriented languages like Java, where polymorphism is typically achieved through class hierarchies and interfaces, Clojure's multimethods offer a more flexible approach. They allow you to define behavior based on arbitrary dispatch criteria, making them a versatile tool in your functional programming toolkit.

### Understanding Multimethods

Multimethods in Clojure are a way to define functions that can have multiple implementations, with the specific implementation chosen based on the result of a dispatch function. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in how you structure your code, as the dispatch logic can be based on any criteria you choose.

#### Key Concepts

- **Polymorphism**: The ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- **Dispatch Function**: A function that determines which method implementation to use based on its return value.
- **Method Implementations**: Different versions of a function that handle specific cases as determined by the dispatch function.

### Defining Multimethods

To define a multimethod in Clojure, you use the `defmulti` and `defmethod` constructs. Let's explore these in detail.

#### `defmulti`

The `defmulti` function is used to define a new multimethod. It takes a name and a dispatch function as arguments. The dispatch function is called with the same arguments as the multimethod and its return value is used to select the appropriate method implementation.

```clojure
(defmulti area :shape)
```

In this example, we define a multimethod `area` that dispatches based on the `:shape` key of its argument.

#### `defmethod`

The `defmethod` function is used to define a method implementation for a specific dispatch value. It takes the name of the multimethod, a dispatch value, and a function body.

```clojure
(defmethod area :circle
  [{:keys [radius]}]
  (* Math/PI radius radius))

(defmethod area :rectangle
  [{:keys [length width]}]
  (* length width))
```

Here, we define two method implementations for the `area` multimethod: one for circles and one for rectangles. The dispatch value `:circle` or `:rectangle` determines which implementation is used.

### Dispatch Functions

Dispatch functions are central to the operation of multimethods. They determine which method implementation to use by returning a dispatch value. This value can be anything: a keyword, a string, a number, or even a more complex data structure.

#### Example: Dispatching on Multiple Criteria

Consider a scenario where you want to dispatch based on both the shape and the color of an object. You can achieve this by returning a composite dispatch value from the dispatch function.

```clojure
(defmulti describe (fn [shape] [(get shape :shape) (get shape :color)]))

(defmethod describe [:circle :red]
  [shape]
  "A red circle")

(defmethod describe [:rectangle :blue]
  [shape]
  "A blue rectangle")
```

In this example, the dispatch function returns a vector containing both the shape and the color, allowing for more granular control over method selection.

### Use Cases for Multimethods

Multimethods are particularly useful in scenarios where:

- **Complex Dispatch Logic**: You need to dispatch based on multiple or complex criteria.
- **Open for Extension**: You want to add new cases without modifying existing code.
- **Separation of Concerns**: You want to separate dispatch logic from method implementations.

#### Example: Handling Different File Formats

Suppose you are building a system that processes different file formats. You can use multimethods to handle each format separately.

```clojure
(defmulti process-file :format)

(defmethod process-file :csv
  [file]
  (println "Processing CSV file"))

(defmethod process-file :json
  [file]
  (println "Processing JSON file"))

(defmethod process-file :xml
  [file]
  (println "Processing XML file"))
```

This approach allows you to easily add support for new file formats by simply defining new method implementations.

### Comparing Multimethods and Protocols

While both multimethods and protocols provide polymorphic behavior, they serve different purposes and have different strengths.

- **Protocols**: Best suited for defining a fixed set of operations that can be implemented by different types. They are similar to Java interfaces.
- **Multimethods**: Offer more flexibility in dispatching logic and are not limited to a fixed set of operations.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the following code snippets to deepen your understanding of multimethods:

1. Modify the `area` multimethod to handle a new shape, such as a triangle.
2. Create a new multimethod that dispatches based on the type and size of a collection (e.g., list, vector, map).
3. Implement a multimethod that processes different types of user actions (e.g., login, logout, register).

### Visualizing Multimethod Dispatch

To better understand how multimethod dispatch works, consider the following flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Call Multimethod] --> B{Dispatch Function};
    B -->|Returns :circle| C[Invoke Circle Method];
    B -->|Returns :rectangle| D[Invoke Rectangle Method];
    B -->|Returns :triangle| E[Invoke Triangle Method];
```
