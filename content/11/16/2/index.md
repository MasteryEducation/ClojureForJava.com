## 16.2 Writing Basic Macros

Welcome to the world of Clojure macros, a powerful feature that allows you to extend the language and create custom syntactic constructs. As experienced Java developers, you may be familiar with the concept of metaprogramming, but Clojure takes it to a new level with its macro system. In this section, we'll explore how to define basic macros, understand quoting and syntax quoting, and see how macros handle arguments. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to write your own macros and leverage them to build more expressive and concise Clojure code.

### Defining Macros

In Clojure, macros are defined using the `defmacro` construct. Macros operate on the code itself, transforming it before it is evaluated. This allows you to create new language constructs and control the evaluation process. Let's start by defining a simple macro and understanding its structure.

```clojure
(defmacro my-macro [arg]
  `(println "The argument is:" ~arg))
```

In this example, `my-macro` is a macro that takes a single argument `arg`. The body of the macro uses syntax quoting (`` ` ``) to construct a new expression. The tilde (`~`) is used to unquote `arg`, allowing its value to be inserted into the quoted expression.

#### Key Points:

- **Macros are defined using `defmacro`.**
- **Macros transform code before evaluation.**
- **Syntax quoting (`` ` ``) and unquoting (`~`) are used to construct new expressions.**

### Quoting and Syntax Quoting

Quoting is a crucial concept in macros, as it allows you to treat code as data. In Clojure, there are two types of quoting: regular quoting (`'`) and syntax quoting (`` ` ``). Understanding the difference between them is essential for writing effective macros.

#### Regular Quoting

Regular quoting is done using the single quote (`'`). It prevents the evaluation of an expression, treating it as a literal list.

```clojure
'(1 2 3) ; => (1 2 3)
```

In this example, the list `(1 2 3)` is not evaluated; it's treated as a literal list.

#### Syntax Quoting

Syntax quoting (`` ` ``) is more powerful than regular quoting. It not only prevents evaluation but also resolves symbols to their fully qualified names, ensuring that the code is evaluated in the correct context.

```clojure
`(println "Hello, World!") ; => (clojure.core/println "Hello, World!")
```

Here, `println` is resolved to `clojure.core/println`, ensuring that the correct function is called.

#### Unquoting

Within a syntax-quoted expression, you can use unquoting (`~`) to evaluate specific parts of the expression.

```clojure
(defmacro greet [name]
  `(println "Hello," ~name))

(greet "Alice") ; => Hello, Alice
```

In this macro, `~name` is unquoted, allowing its value to be inserted into the syntax-quoted expression.

### Macro Arguments

One of the unique aspects of macros is that they receive unevaluated code as their arguments. This allows macros to manipulate the code itself, providing powerful metaprogramming capabilities.

Consider the following example:

```clojure
(defmacro debug [expr]
  `(do
     (println "Evaluating:" '~expr)
     (let [result# ~expr]
       (println "Result:" result#)
       result#)))

(debug (+ 1 2)) ; => Evaluating: (+ 1 2)
                ; => Result: 3
                ; => 3
```

In this macro, `expr` is received as unevaluated code. The macro prints the expression, evaluates it, and then prints the result. The `result#` symbol is generated using a gensym to ensure it is unique, preventing any naming conflicts.

### Examples of Basic Macros

Let's explore some simple macros to solidify our understanding. We'll start with a custom `when` macro, which is a common example used to demonstrate macro capabilities.

#### Custom `when` Macro

The `when` macro in Clojure is a conditional construct that executes a body of code only if a condition is true. Let's implement a simplified version of it.

```clojure
(defmacro my-when [condition & body]
  `(if ~condition
     (do ~@body)))

(my-when true
  (println "This will be printed.")
  (println "So will this."))

(my-when false
  (println "This will not be printed."))
```

In this macro, `my-when` takes a `condition` and a variable number of `body` expressions. The `&` symbol is used to collect the remaining arguments into a list. The `~@` syntax is used to splice the `body` expressions into the `do` form.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `my-when` macro by modifying the condition and adding more expressions to the body. Observe how the macro expands and executes the code.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data and control in macros, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```

### Knowledge Check

Let's test your understanding of Clojure macros with a few questions and challenges.

1. **What is the purpose of syntax quoting in macros?**
2. **How does unquoting differ from quoting?**
3. **Write a macro that logs the execution time of an expression.**

### Exercises

1. **Create a macro that repeats an expression a specified number of times.**
2. **Implement a macro that swaps the values of two variables.**

### Summary

In this section, we've explored the basics of writing macros in Clojure. We've learned how to define macros using `defmacro`, use quoting and syntax quoting, and handle macro arguments. By practicing with simple examples, you can start leveraging macros to create more expressive and concise Clojure code. As you continue your journey, remember that macros are a powerful tool, but they should be used judiciously to maintain code clarity and readability.
