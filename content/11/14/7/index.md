## 14.7 Use Cases for `core.async`

In this section, we will delve into the practical applications of `core.async` in Clojure, a powerful library that facilitates asynchronous programming. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with concurrency and parallelism concepts. `core.async` provides a unique approach to these challenges, leveraging Clojure's functional paradigm to create scalable and efficient applications. We'll explore several use cases, including pipeline processing, event handling systems, and concurrency patterns, and demonstrate how `core.async` can integrate with other libraries.

### Pipeline Processing

**Pipeline processing** is a common pattern in software development, where data flows through a series of processing stages. Each stage performs a specific transformation or computation, and the output of one stage becomes the input for the next. In Clojure, `core.async` channels can be used to implement these pipelines, allowing data to be processed asynchronously.

#### Implementing a Data Processing Pipeline

Let's start by implementing a simple data processing pipeline using `core.async`. We'll create a pipeline that processes a stream of numbers, doubling each number and then filtering out even numbers.

```clojure
(ns pipeline-example
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go >! <! >!! <!! close!]]))

(defn double [n]
  (* 2 n))

(defn even? [n]
  (zero? (mod n 2)))

(defn process-pipeline [input-ch output-ch]
  (go
    (loop []
      (when-let [value (<! input-ch)]
        (let [doubled (double value)]
          (when (even? doubled)
            (>! output-ch doubled)))
        (recur)))
    (close! output-ch)))

(defn run-pipeline []
  (let [input-ch (chan)
        output-ch (chan)]
    (process-pipeline input-ch output-ch)
    (go
      (doseq [n (range 10)]
        (>! input-ch n))
      (close! input-ch))
    (go
      (loop []
        (when-let [result (<! output-ch)]
          (println "Processed:" result)
          (recur))))))

(run-pipeline)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Channels**: We use `chan` to create channels for input and output.
- **Go Blocks**: The `go` macro is used to create lightweight threads that perform asynchronous operations.
- **Loop and Recur**: We use a loop to continuously read from the input channel, process the data, and write to the output channel.
- **Closing Channels**: Channels are closed using `close!` to signal that no more data will be sent.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with modifying the pipeline to perform different transformations, such as squaring numbers or filtering based on other criteria. Observe how `core.async` handles the asynchronous flow of data.

### Event Handling Systems

**Event-driven systems** are designed to respond to events or messages. These systems are prevalent in applications like message brokers, event buses, and real-time data processing. `core.async` provides an excellent foundation for building such systems due to its non-blocking nature and support for asynchronous communication.

#### Building an Event-Driven System

Consider a simple event-driven system where multiple producers generate events, and multiple consumers process these events. We'll use `core.async` to implement this system.

```clojure
(ns event-system
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go >! <! >!! <!! close!]]))

(defn producer [event-ch id]
  (go
    (dotimes [n 5]
      (let [event {:producer id :value n}]
        (println "Producing event:" event)
        (>! event-ch event)))
    (close! event-ch)))

(defn consumer [event-ch id]
  (go
    (loop []
      (when-let [event (<! event-ch)]
        (println "Consumer" id "processing event:" event)
        (recur)))))

(defn run-event-system []
  (let [event-ch (chan)]
    (doseq [i (range 3)]
      (producer event-ch i))
    (doseq [i (range 2)]
      (consumer event-ch i))))

(run-event-system)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Producers and Consumers**: We define producers that generate events and consumers that process them.
- **Channel Communication**: Events are communicated via a shared channel, allowing producers and consumers to operate independently.
- **Concurrency**: The use of `go` blocks ensures that producers and consumers run concurrently without blocking each other.

#### Try It Yourself

Extend the event-driven system by adding more producers and consumers. Experiment with different event types and processing logic to see how `core.async` manages concurrency.

### Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency patterns like **fan-in**, **fan-out**, and **worker pools** are essential for building scalable applications. `core.async` provides primitives that make it easy to implement these patterns.

#### Fan-In and Fan-Out

**Fan-in** is a pattern where multiple input channels are merged into a single output channel. **Fan-out** is the opposite, where a single input channel is distributed to multiple output channels.

```clojure
(ns concurrency-patterns
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go >! <! >!! <!! close! alts!]]))

(defn fan-in [chs out-ch]
  (doseq [ch chs]
    (go
      (loop []
        (when-let [value (<! ch)]
          (>! out-ch value)
          (recur))))))

(defn fan-out [in-ch out-chs]
  (go
    (loop []
      (when-let [value (<! in-ch)]
        (doseq [out-ch out-chs]
          (>! out-ch value))
        (recur)))))

(defn run-fan-patterns []
  (let [ch1 (chan)
        ch2 (chan)
        out-ch (chan)
        out-chs [(chan) (chan)]]
    (fan-in [ch1 ch2] out-ch)
    (fan-out out-ch out-chs)
    (go
      (doseq [n (range 5)]
        (>! ch1 n)
        (>! ch2 (* 10 n)))
      (close! ch1)
      (close! ch2))
    (go
      (loop []
        (when-let [value (<! out-ch)]
          (println "Fan-in output:" value)
          (recur))))
    (doseq [out-ch out-chs]
      (go
        (loop []
          (when-let [value (<! out-ch)]
            (println "Fan-out output:" value)
            (recur)))))))

(run-fan-patterns)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fan-In**: We merge multiple input channels into a single output channel using a loop that reads from each input channel.
- **Fan-Out**: We distribute data from a single input channel to multiple output channels.

#### Worker Pools

A **worker pool** is a pattern where a fixed number of worker threads process tasks from a shared queue. This pattern is useful for managing resource-intensive tasks.

```clojure
(ns worker-pool
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go >! <! >!! <!! close!]]))

(defn worker [task-ch id]
  (go
    (loop []
      (when-let [task (<! task-ch)]
        (println "Worker" id "processing task:" task)
        (recur)))))

(defn run-worker-pool []
  (let [task-ch (chan)]
    (doseq [i (range 3)]
      (worker task-ch i))
    (go
      (doseq [task (range 10)]
        (>! task-ch task))
      (close! task-ch))))

(run-worker-pool)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Task Channel**: Tasks are sent to a shared channel, and workers read from this channel to process tasks.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple workers operate concurrently, allowing tasks to be processed in parallel.

#### Try It Yourself

Experiment with different numbers of workers and tasks. Observe how `core.async` handles task distribution and processing.

### Integration with Other Libraries

`core.async` can be integrated with other libraries and frameworks to enhance their functionality. For example, it can be used with web frameworks to handle asynchronous requests or with data processing libraries to manage concurrent data flows.

#### Integrating with Web Frameworks

Consider integrating `core.async` with a web framework like Ring to handle asynchronous HTTP requests.

```clojure
(ns web-integration
  (:require [clojure.core.async :refer [chan go >! <! >!! <!! close!]]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [ring.util.response :refer [response]]))

(defn async-handler [request]
  (let [response-ch (chan)]
    (go
      (let [result (<! (process-request request))]
        (>! response-ch (response result))))
    response-ch))

(defn process-request [request]
  (go
    ;; Simulate processing
    (Thread/sleep 1000)
    "Processed request"))

(defn start-server []
  (run-jetty async-handler {:port 3000}))

(start-server)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Asynchronous Handler**: We define an asynchronous handler that processes requests using `core.async`.
- **Response Channel**: The handler returns a channel that will eventually contain the HTTP response.

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the server to handle different types of requests or integrate with other web frameworks. Observe how `core.async` manages asynchronous request handling.
