## 14.8 State Management in Web and Mobile Apps

In the realm of web and mobile app development, managing application state efficiently is crucial for building responsive and scalable applications. Clojure and its JavaScript counterpart, ClojureScript, offer powerful tools and frameworks that embrace functional programming principles to tackle state management challenges. In this section, we will explore how to manage state in web and mobile applications using Clojure, focusing on frameworks like Reagent and re-frame, which leverage reactive programming principles.

### React and Reagent

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering. Reagent is a ClojureScript interface to React, allowing developers to write React components using ClojureScript. Reagent brings the benefits of Clojure's immutable data structures and functional programming to the React ecosystem.

#### Key Features of Reagent

- **Reactive Components**: Reagent components are reactive, meaning they automatically re-render when their data changes. This is achieved through the use of ClojureScript's atom, which is a reference type that holds state and can be watched for changes.
- **Simplicity and Conciseness**: Reagent allows you to write concise and expressive UI code using ClojureScript's syntax and data structures.
- **Interoperability with React**: Reagent seamlessly interoperates with React, allowing you to use existing React components and libraries.

#### Example: Creating a Simple Reagent Component

Let's start by creating a simple Reagent component that displays a counter and a button to increment it.

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]))

(defn counter-component []
  (let [count (r/atom 0)] ; Create an atom to hold the state
    (fn [] ; Return a function that renders the component
      [:div
       [:p "Current count: " @count] ; Dereference the atom to get the current value
       [:button {:on-click #(swap! count inc)} "Increment"]])))

(defn mount-root []
  (r/render [counter-component] (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(defn init []
  (mount-root))
```

In this example, we define a `counter-component` that uses an atom to hold the count state. The component re-renders automatically whenever the atom's value changes, thanks to Reagent's reactivity.

### Managing Application State

Managing state in a reactive front-end application involves handling both local component state and global application state. Reagent provides atoms for local state, but for more complex applications, a global state management solution is often necessary.

#### Local State with Atoms

Atoms are ideal for managing local component state. They are mutable references that can be updated and watched for changes. In Reagent, atoms are used to trigger re-renders when their state changes.

#### Global State with re-frame

For managing global application state, re-frame is a popular framework built on top of Reagent. It provides a structured way to manage state and side effects in a ClojureScript application.

##### Key Concepts in re-frame

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: re-frame uses an event-driven architecture where state changes are triggered by events.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: re-frame enforces a unidirectional data flow, similar to the Flux architecture, where data flows in a single direction through the application.
- **Subscriptions and Reactions**: re-frame uses subscriptions to access state and reactions to automatically update components when state changes.

#### Example: Managing Global State with re-frame

Let's create a simple re-frame application that manages a global counter state.

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [reagent.core :as r]))

;; Define an event to increment the counter
(rf/reg-event-db
 :increment-counter
 (fn [db _]
   (update db :counter inc)))

;; Define a subscription to access the counter state
(rf/reg-sub
 :counter
 (fn [db _]
   (:counter db)))

;; Define a component that uses the subscription
(defn counter-component []
  (let [counter @(rf/subscribe [:counter])]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:p "Current count: " counter]
       [:button {:on-click #(rf/dispatch [:increment-counter])} "Increment"]])))

(defn mount-root []
  (r/render [counter-component] (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(defn init []
  (rf/dispatch-sync [:initialize-db]) ; Initialize the application state
  (mount-root))
```

In this example, we define an event `:increment-counter` to update the counter state and a subscription `:counter` to access the state. The `counter-component` uses the subscription to display the current counter value and dispatches the `:increment-counter` event when the button is clicked.

### Unidirectional Data Flow

Unidirectional data flow is a core principle in re-frame applications. It ensures that data flows in a single direction, making the application more predictable and easier to debug.

#### Data Flow in re-frame

1. **Events**: User interactions or other triggers dispatch events.
2. **Event Handlers**: Event handlers update the application state based on the dispatched events.
3. **Subscriptions**: Components subscribe to parts of the application state.
4. **Reactions**: Components automatically re-render when the subscribed state changes.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User Interaction] -->|Dispatch Event| B[Event Handler];
    B -->|Update State| C[Application State];
    C -->|Subscribe| D[Component];
    D -->|Re-render| A;
```

### Real-Time Data Updates

Handling real-time data updates is essential for building interactive user interfaces. In ClojureScript, you can use WebSockets or other real-time data sources to update the application state.

#### Example: Real-Time Updates with WebSockets

Let's create a simple example that updates the application state in real-time using WebSockets.

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [reagent.core :as r]
            [cljs.core.async :refer [<!]]
            [cljs-http.client :as http]))

;; Define an event to update the state with new data
(rf/reg-event-db
 :update-data
 (fn [db [_ new-data]]
   (assoc db :data new-data)))

;; Define a subscription to access the data
(rf/reg-sub
 :data
 (fn [db _]
   (:data db)))

;; Define a component that displays the data
(defn data-component []
  (let [data @(rf/subscribe [:data])]
    (fn []
      [:div
       [:p "Real-time data: " data]])))

(defn mount-root []
  (r/render [data-component] (.getElementById js/document "app")))

(defn init []
  ;; Simulate receiving data from a WebSocket
  (go-loop []
    (let [response (<! (http/get "/api/data"))]
      (rf/dispatch [:update-data (:body response)])
      (<! (timeout 1000)) ; Wait for 1 second before fetching new data
      (recur)))
  (mount-root))
```

In this example, we simulate receiving real-time data from a WebSocket by periodically fetching data from an API and updating the application state using the `:update-data` event.

### Cross-Platform Development

Clojure and ClojureScript can be used for cross-platform development, allowing you to build web and mobile applications using the same codebase. Libraries like React Native and frameworks like Expo enable ClojureScript to be used for mobile app development.

#### Using ClojureScript with React Native

React Native allows you to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. With ClojureScript, you can leverage the same functional programming principles and libraries to build mobile apps.

##### Example: Building a Simple Mobile App with Reagent and React Native

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [reagent.core :as r]
            [reagent.react-native :as rn]))

(defn app-root []
  (let [count (r/atom 0)]
    (fn []
      [rn/view
       [rn/text {:style {:font-size 20}} "Hello, ClojureScript!"]
       [rn/button {:title "Increment"
                   :on-press #(swap! count inc)}]
       [rn/text {:style {:font-size 20}} (str "Count: " @count)]])))

(defn init []
  (rn/register-root-component "MyApp" app-root))
```

In this example, we create a simple mobile app using Reagent and React Native. The app displays a button that increments a counter, demonstrating how to manage state in a mobile application using ClojureScript.
