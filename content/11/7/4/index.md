## 7.4 Working with Recursive Data Structures

In this section, we delve into the fascinating world of recursive data structures in Clojure. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with data structures like linked lists and trees. In Clojure, these structures take on a new dimension, thanks to the language's functional nature and emphasis on immutability. Let's explore how recursive data structures are defined, traversed, and manipulated in Clojure, and how they can be applied to real-world problems such as parsing JSON or XML data.

### Understanding Recursive Structures

Recursive data structures are those that reference themselves in their definition. This self-referential nature allows them to represent complex, hierarchical data in a compact and flexible manner. Common examples include linked lists, trees, and graphs.

#### Linked Lists

In Java, a linked list is typically implemented using nodes that contain data and a reference to the next node. In Clojure, lists are inherently recursive and are a fundamental part of the language. Here's a simple example of a linked list in Java:

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    Node head;

    void add(int data) {
        if (head == null) {
            head = new Node(data);
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = new Node(data);
        }
    }
}
```

In Clojure, lists are built-in and can be created using the `list` function or the literal syntax:

```clojure
(def my-list '(1 2 3 4 5))
```

Clojure lists are immutable and persistent, meaning that operations on them return new lists rather than modifying the original.

#### Trees

Trees are another common recursive data structure. They consist of nodes, each of which may have zero or more child nodes. A binary tree, for example, is a tree where each node has at most two children.

In Java, a binary tree node might look like this:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```

In Clojure, trees can be represented using nested maps or vectors. Here's an example of a simple binary tree:

```clojure
(def binary-tree
  {:value 10
   :left {:value 5
          :left nil
          :right nil}
   :right {:value 15
           :left nil
           :right nil}})
```

### Traversing Trees

Traversing a tree involves visiting each node in a specific order. Common traversal strategies include pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.

#### Pre-order Traversal

In pre-order traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order: root, left subtree, right subtree.

Here's how you might implement pre-order traversal in Clojure:

```clojure
(defn pre-order-traversal [tree]
  (when tree
    (println (:value tree))
    (pre-order-traversal (:left tree))
    (pre-order-traversal (:right tree))))

(pre-order-traversal binary-tree)
```

#### In-order Traversal

In in-order traversal, the nodes are visited in this order: left subtree, root, right subtree. This is particularly useful for binary search trees, as it visits nodes in ascending order.

```clojure
(defn in-order-traversal [tree]
  (when tree
    (in-order-traversal (:left tree))
    (println (:value tree))
    (in-order-traversal (:right tree))))

(in-order-traversal binary-tree)
```

#### Post-order Traversal

In post-order traversal, the nodes are visited in this order: left subtree, right subtree, root. This is useful for deleting a tree, as it ensures that child nodes are processed before their parent.

```clojure
(defn post-order-traversal [tree]
  (when tree
    (post-order-traversal (:left tree))
    (post-order-traversal (:right tree))
    (println (:value tree))))

(post-order-traversal binary-tree)
```

### Manipulating Nested Data

Clojure's immutable data structures make it particularly well-suited for manipulating deeply nested data. Let's explore how to work with nested maps and vectors.

#### Nested Maps

Nested maps are common in Clojure, especially when dealing with JSON or configuration data. Here's an example of a nested map:

```clojure
(def nested-map
  {:user {:name "Alice"
          :address {:city "Wonderland"
                    :zip 12345}}})
```

To access nested data, you can use the `get-in` function:

```clojure
(get-in nested-map [:user :address :city]) ; => "Wonderland"
```

To update nested data, use the `assoc-in` function:

```clojure
(def updated-map (assoc-in nested-map [:user :address :zip] 54321))
```

#### Nested Vectors

Nested vectors are useful for representing matrices or grids. Here's an example of a 2x2 matrix:

```clojure
(def matrix [[1 2]
             [3 4]])
```

You can access elements using the `get-in` function:

```clojure
(get-in matrix [1 0]) ; => 3
```

To update an element, use the `assoc-in` function:

```clojure
(def updated-matrix (assoc-in matrix [0 1] 5))
```

### Practical Applications

Recursive data structures are not just academic exercises; they have practical applications in many domains.

#### Parsing JSON

JSON data is inherently hierarchical and can be represented as nested maps and vectors in Clojure. Here's an example of parsing JSON data:

```clojure
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])

(def json-data "{\"user\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}}")

(def parsed-data (json/parse-string json-data true))

(get-in parsed-data [:user :name]) ; => "Alice"
```

#### Parsing XML

XML data can also be represented as nested structures. Here's an example using the `clojure.data.xml` library:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.xml :as xml])

(def xml-data "<user><name>Alice</name><age>30</age></user>")

(def parsed-xml (xml/parse-str xml-data))

(defn extract-xml-value [element]
  (first (:content element)))

(extract-xml-value (first (:content (first (:content parsed-xml))))) ; => "Alice"
```

### Visual Aids

To better understand how recursive data structures work, let's visualize a binary tree and its traversal.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[10] --> B[5];
    A --> C[15];
    B --> D[null];
    B --> E[null];
    C --> F[null];
    C --> G[null];
```

**Caption:** This diagram represents a simple binary tree with root node 10, and child nodes 5 and 15.
