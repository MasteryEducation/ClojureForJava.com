## 18.3 Property-Based Testing with `test.check`

In the realm of software testing, property-based testing offers a powerful approach to ensure the robustness and correctness of your code. Unlike traditional example-based testing, which checks specific input-output pairs, property-based testing focuses on the properties that should hold true for a wide range of inputs. In this section, we'll explore how to leverage `test.check`, a property-based testing library in Clojure, to enhance your testing strategy.

### Exploring Generative Testing

Property-based testing is a paradigm where you define properties that your code should satisfy for all possible inputs. `test.check` automates this process by generating random inputs and checking if the properties hold. This approach is particularly useful for uncovering edge cases that you might not have considered.

#### Why Property-Based Testing?

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: By generating a wide range of inputs, property-based testing can uncover edge cases that example-based tests might miss.
- **Focus on Properties**: Instead of writing tests for specific cases, you define properties that should always be true, leading to more robust code.
- **Automated Test Case Generation**: `test.check` automatically generates test cases, saving time and effort in writing individual tests.

### Defining Generators

Generators are at the heart of property-based testing. They produce random values of a specific type, which are then used to test your properties. `test.check` provides a variety of built-in generators and allows you to compose custom ones.

#### Built-in Generators

`test.check` includes a range of built-in generators for common data types:

- **`gen/int`**: Generates random integers.
- **`gen/boolean`**: Generates random boolean values.
- **`gen/string`**: Generates random strings.
- **`gen/vector`**: Generates vectors of random elements.

Here's an example of using a built-in generator to create random integers:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check.generators :as gen])

(def int-gen (gen/int))
```

#### Composing Custom Generators

You can compose custom generators by combining existing ones. For instance, to generate a vector of random integers, you can use the `gen/vector` generator:

```clojure
(def vector-of-ints-gen (gen/vector int-gen))
```

To create more complex generators, you can use `gen/fmap` to transform generated values:

```clojure
(def positive-int-gen
  (gen/fmap #(Math/abs %) int-gen))
```

### Writing Properties

Once you have defined your generators, the next step is to write properties that your code should satisfy. A property is a function that takes generated inputs and returns a boolean indicating whether the property holds.

#### Defining a Simple Property

Let's define a simple property for a function that reverses a list. The property we want to test is that reversing a list twice should yield the original list:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check.properties :as prop])

(def reverse-property
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector int-gen)]
    (= v (reverse (reverse v)))))
```

#### Running the Property

To run the property, use the `clojure.test.check` library:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test.check :as tc])

(tc/quick-check 100 reverse-property)
```

This will run the property 100 times with different random inputs.

### Shrinking Failing Cases

One of the powerful features of `test.check` is its ability to shrink failing test cases to minimal examples. When a property fails, `test.check` attempts to simplify the input that caused the failure, making it easier to debug.

#### Understanding Shrinking

Shrinking is the process of reducing a failing input to its simplest form while still causing the test to fail. This helps you quickly identify the root cause of the issue.

For example, if a property fails with a large vector, `test.check` will try to find the smallest vector that still causes the failure.

#### Example of Shrinking

Consider a property that checks if the sum of a list is always positive:

```clojure
(def sum-positive-property
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector positive-int-gen)]
    (pos? (reduce + v))))
```

If this property fails, `test.check` will shrink the vector to the smallest size that still causes the failure, helping you pinpoint the problem.

### Practical Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of property-based testing with `test.check`.

#### Example 1: Testing a Sorting Function

Suppose we have a sorting function and we want to test its correctness. We can define properties such as:

- The output list should be sorted.
- The output list should have the same elements as the input list.

```clojure
(def sort-property
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector int-gen)]
    (let [sorted-v (sort v)]
      (and (= (count v) (count sorted-v))
           (apply <= sorted-v)))))
```

#### Example 2: Testing a String Manipulation Function

Consider a function that converts a string to uppercase. We can define a property that checks if the length of the string remains unchanged:

```clojure
(def uppercase-property
  (prop/for-all [s gen/string]
    (= (count s) (count (clojure.string/upper-case s)))))
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored property-based testing with `test.check`, try modifying the examples to test different properties or use different generators. Experiment with creating custom generators and see how they can be used to test more complex properties.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data through property-based testing, let's visualize the process using a flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Define Generators] --> B[Write Properties];
    B --> C[Run Properties];
    C --> D{Property Holds?};
    D -->|Yes| E[Success];
    D -->|No| F[Shrink Failing Case];
    F --> C;
```
