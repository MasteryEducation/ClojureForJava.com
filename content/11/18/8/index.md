## 18.8 Mocking and Stubbing in Clojure Tests

As experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, you are likely familiar with the concepts of mocking and stubbing in testing. These techniques are essential for isolating the unit of work being tested, allowing you to focus on the behavior of the code without external dependencies. In this section, we will explore how these concepts apply in the context of Clojure, a functional programming language, and how you can leverage them to write effective tests.

### Understanding Mocks and Stubs

**Mocks** and **stubs** are both used to simulate the behavior of complex objects or systems in tests. However, they serve slightly different purposes:

- **Stubs**: These are used to provide predefined responses to method calls. They are typically used to simulate the behavior of an object or system that your code interacts with, allowing you to test how your code handles various responses.

- **Mocks**: These are used to verify interactions between objects. They not only simulate behavior but also record information about how they were used, such as which methods were called and with what arguments.

#### When to Use Mocks and Stubs

- **Use Stubs** when you need to control the indirect inputs of the system under test by replacing real objects with controlled ones.
- **Use Mocks** when you need to verify that certain interactions between objects occur as expected.

### `with-redefs` Usage

In Clojure, one of the primary tools for mocking and stubbing is `with-redefs`. This macro allows you to temporarily redefine global vars within a specific scope, making it ideal for testing purposes.

#### Example: Using `with-redefs`

Let's consider a simple example where we have a function that fetches data from an external API:

```clojure
(ns myapp.api)

(defn fetch-data [url]
  ;; Imagine this function makes an HTTP request to the given URL
  (println "Fetching data from" url)
  {:status 200 :body "Sample data"})
```

To test a function that relies on `fetch-data`, we can use `with-redefs` to replace `fetch-data` with a stub:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.api :refer [fetch-data]]))

(deftest test-process-data
  (with-redefs [fetch-data (fn [_] {:status 200 :body "Mock data"})]
    (let [result (process-data "http://example.com")]
      (is (= "Processed Mock data" result)))))
```

In this example, `fetch-data` is temporarily redefined to return a mock response, allowing us to test `process-data` without making an actual HTTP request.

### Testing Side Effects

Functional programming emphasizes pure functions, but side effects are sometimes unavoidable, especially when dealing with I/O operations. Testing side effects involves intercepting function calls and verifying interactions.

#### Intercepting Function Calls

You can use `with-redefs` to intercept calls to functions that produce side effects. Here's an example:

```clojure
(ns myapp.logger)

(defn log-message [message]
  ;; Imagine this function writes to a log file
  (println "Log:" message))

(ns myapp.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
            [myapp.logger :refer [log-message]]))

(deftest test-log-interaction
  (let [log-calls (atom [])]
    (with-redefs [log-message (fn [msg] (swap! log-calls conj msg))]
      (do-something-that-logs)
      (is (= ["Expected log message"] @log-calls)))))
```

In this test, we redefine `log-message` to capture log messages in an atom, allowing us to verify that the expected log message was produced.

### Limitations of Mocks and Stubs

While mocks and stubs are powerful tools, they come with potential drawbacks:

- **Tight Coupling**: Overusing mocks can lead to tests that are tightly coupled to the implementation details of the code, making them brittle and difficult to maintain.
- **False Sense of Security**: Tests that rely heavily on mocks may pass even if the code is not functioning correctly in a real environment, as the mocks may not accurately simulate real-world behavior.

### Alternatives to Mocks and Stubs

To mitigate the limitations of mocks and stubs, consider using alternatives such as protocols or dependency injection.

#### Using Protocols

Protocols in Clojure provide a way to define a set of functions that can be implemented by different types. This allows you to swap out implementations for testing purposes.

```clojure
(ns myapp.service)

(defprotocol DataService
  (fetch-data [this url]))

(defrecord RealDataService []
  DataService
  (fetch-data [_ url]
    ;; Real implementation
    ))

(defrecord MockDataService []
  DataService
  (fetch-data [_ url]
    ;; Mock implementation
    {:status 200 :body "Mock data"}))
```

In your tests, you can use `MockDataService` to simulate the behavior of `RealDataService`.

#### Dependency Injection

Dependency injection involves passing dependencies as arguments to functions, allowing you to replace them with mocks or stubs in tests.

```clojure
(defn process-data [data-service url]
  (let [response (fetch-data data-service url)]
    ;; Process response
    ))

(deftest test-process-data
  (let [mock-service (->MockDataService)]
    (is (= "Processed Mock data" (process-data mock-service "http://example.com")))))
```

### Conclusion

Mocking and stubbing are essential techniques for testing in Clojure, especially when dealing with side effects. By using tools like `with-redefs`, protocols, and dependency injection, you can write effective tests that isolate the unit of work and verify interactions. However, it's important to be mindful of the limitations of these techniques and consider alternatives when appropriate.
