## 15.7 Functional Domain Modeling

In this section, we delve into the art of functional domain modeling using Clojure. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with object-oriented domain modeling, where classes and objects are used to represent entities and their behaviors. In contrast, functional domain modeling emphasizes the use of data structures and pure functions to represent and manipulate business domains. This approach not only aligns with the principles of functional programming but also offers significant advantages in terms of scalability, maintainability, and simplicity.

### Modeling with Data

Functional domain modeling begins with the premise that data is central to representing a business domain. In Clojure, data structures such as maps, vectors, and sets are used to model entities and their relationships. This approach contrasts with Java's class-based modeling, where behavior and state are encapsulated within objects.

#### Emphasizing Data Structures

In Clojure, we model domains using data structures that are both flexible and expressive. Let's consider an example of modeling an e-commerce system. In a typical e-commerce domain, we have entities such as `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order`. Each of these entities can be represented using Clojure's data structures.

```clojure
(def product
  {:id 101
   :name "Laptop"
   :price 999.99
   :category "Electronics"})

(def customer
  {:id 202
   :name "Alice"
   :email "alice@example.com"
   :address "123 Elm Street"})

(def order
  {:order-id 303
   :customer-id 202
   :products [{:product-id 101 :quantity 1}]
   :total 999.99})
```

In this example, we use maps to represent entities. Each map contains key-value pairs that describe the attributes of the entity. This approach is simple yet powerful, allowing us to easily manipulate and transform data.

#### Advantages of Data-Centric Modeling

1. **Simplicity**: Using data structures to model domains reduces complexity by separating data from behavior. This separation makes it easier to reason about the system and understand how data flows through it.

2. **Flexibility**: Data structures are inherently flexible, allowing us to easily modify and extend models without the need for complex inheritance hierarchies or design patterns.

3. **Interoperability**: Data structures can be easily serialized and deserialized, making them ideal for communication between different parts of a system or across network boundaries.

### Pure Functions for Business Logic

In functional domain modeling, business logic is expressed as pure functions that operate on data models. Pure functions are deterministic and side-effect-free, making them easier to test, debug, and reason about.

#### Writing Pure Functions

Let's continue with our e-commerce example and write a pure function to calculate the total price of an order.

```clojure
(defn calculate-total
  [order products]
  (reduce
    (fn [total {:keys [product-id quantity]}]
      (let [product (some #(when (= (:id %) product-id) %) products)]
        (+ total (* (:price product) quantity))))
    0
    (:products order)))
```

In this function, `calculate-total` takes an `order` and a list of `products` as arguments. It uses `reduce` to iterate over the products in the order, calculating the total price by multiplying the price of each product by its quantity. This function is pure because it does not modify any external state and always produces the same output for the same input.

#### Benefits of Pure Functions

1. **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test because they do not depend on external state. We can write unit tests that verify the correctness of the function by providing known inputs and checking the outputs.

2. **Composability**: Pure functions can be composed to build more complex operations. This composability allows us to build complex business logic by combining simple functions.

3. **Predictability**: Pure functions are predictable and reliable, reducing the likelihood of bugs and making the system more robust.

### Immutability in Models

Immutability is a cornerstone of functional programming and plays a crucial role in functional domain modeling. In Clojure, data structures are immutable by default, meaning that once they are created, they cannot be changed. Instead, any modification results in a new data structure.

#### Benefits of Immutability

1. **Thread Safety**: Immutable data structures are inherently thread-safe, eliminating the need for locks or synchronization when accessing shared data in concurrent applications.

2. **Consistency**: Immutability ensures that data remains consistent throughout its lifecycle, reducing the risk of unintended side effects and making it easier to reason about the system.

3. **Ease of Debugging**: Immutable data structures simplify debugging by ensuring that data does not change unexpectedly. This predictability makes it easier to trace the flow of data and identify the source of errors.

#### Example: Updating an Order

Let's see how immutability works in practice by updating an order in our e-commerce system.

```clojure
(defn add-product-to-order
  [order product-id quantity]
  (update order :products conj {:product-id product-id :quantity quantity}))

(def updated-order
  (add-product-to-order order 102 2))
```

In this example, `add-product-to-order` is a pure function that takes an `order`, a `product-id`, and a `quantity` as arguments. It uses `update` to add a new product to the order's products list. The original `order` remains unchanged, and a new `updated-order` is returned.

### Examples: Modeling an E-commerce System

To illustrate functional domain modeling in action, let's build a simple e-commerce system using Clojure. We'll model the domain using data structures, implement business logic as pure functions, and leverage immutability to ensure consistency and thread safety.

#### Defining the Domain

We'll start by defining the core entities of our e-commerce system: `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order`.

```clojure
(def products
  [{:id 101 :name "Laptop" :price 999.99 :category "Electronics"}
   {:id 102 :name "Smartphone" :price 499.99 :category "Electronics"}
   {:id 103 :name "Headphones" :price 199.99 :category "Accessories"}])

(def customers
  [{:id 201 :name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com" :address "123 Elm Street"}
   {:id 202 :name "Bob" :email "bob@example.com" :address "456 Oak Avenue"}])

(def orders
  [{:order-id 301 :customer-id 201 :products [{:product-id 101 :quantity 1}] :total 999.99}
   {:order-id 302 :customer-id 202 :products [{:product-id 102 :quantity 2}] :total 999.98}])
```

#### Implementing Business Logic

Next, we'll implement some business logic using pure functions. We'll start with a function to find a customer by their ID.

```clojure
(defn find-customer
  [customers customer-id]
  (some #(when (= (:id %) customer-id) %) customers))
```

This function uses `some` to iterate over the list of customers and return the customer with the matching ID.

#### Calculating Order Totals

We'll also implement a function to calculate the total price of an order, as we did earlier.

```clojure
(defn calculate-order-total
  [order products]
  (reduce
    (fn [total {:keys [product-id quantity]}]
      (let [product (some #(when (= (:id %) product-id) %) products)]
        (+ total (* (:price product) quantity))))
    0
    (:products order)))
```

#### Updating Orders

Finally, we'll implement a function to add a product to an order, demonstrating immutability in action.

```clojure
(defn add-product
  [order product-id quantity]
  (update order :products conj {:product-id product-id :quantity quantity}))

(def updated-order
  (add-product (first orders) 103 1))
```

### Visualizing Functional Domain Modeling

To better understand the flow of data and the relationships between entities in our e-commerce system, let's visualize the domain model using a diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Product {
        +int id
        +string name
        +float price
        +string category
    }
    class Customer {
        +int id
        +string name
        +string email
        +string address
    }
    class Order {
        +int order-id
        +int customer-id
        +list~Product~ products
        +float total
    }
    Order --> Customer : belongs to
    Order --> Product : contains
```

This diagram represents the relationships between `Product`, `Customer`, and `Order` in our e-commerce system. Each `Order` belongs to a `Customer` and contains one or more `Products`.
