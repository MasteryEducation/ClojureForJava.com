## 9.6 Advanced Collections: Queues, Stacks, and Heaps

In this section, we delve into advanced collections such as queues, stacks, and heaps, exploring their implementation and usage in Clojure. These data structures are essential for various applications, from task scheduling to algorithm optimization. By leveraging Clojure's functional programming paradigm, we can create efficient, immutable versions of these structures that are both performant and easy to reason about.

### Functional Queues

Queues are fundamental data structures that follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a functional context, implementing queues involves ensuring immutability and leveraging persistent data structures.

#### Implementing Queues in Clojure

In Clojure, a queue can be implemented using a list for the front and a vector for the back. This approach allows for efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.

```clojure
(defn create-queue []
  {:front '()
   :back []})

(defn enqueue [queue element]
  (update queue :back conj element))

(defn dequeue [queue]
  (let [{:keys [front back]} queue]
    (if (empty? front)
      (let [new-front (reverse back)]
        {:front (rest new-front)
         :back []})
      {:front (rest front)
       :back back})))

(defn peek-queue [queue]
  (let [{:keys [front back]} queue]
    (if (empty? front)
      (first (reverse back))
      (first front))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **`create-queue`**: Initializes an empty queue.
- **`enqueue`**: Adds an element to the back of the queue.
- **`dequeue`**: Removes an element from the front. If the front is empty, it reverses the back to maintain FIFO order.
- **`peek-queue`**: Returns the front element without removing it.

#### Java Comparison

In Java, queues are often implemented using linked lists or arrays. The Clojure implementation above mirrors the linked list approach but ensures immutability by using persistent data structures.

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.add(1); // Enqueue
queue.poll(); // Dequeue
queue.peek(); // Peek
```

### Stacks

Stacks operate on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In Clojure, stacks can be efficiently implemented using lists, which naturally support LIFO operations.

#### Implementing Stacks in Clojure

```clojure
(defn create-stack []
  '())

(defn push [stack element]
  (cons element stack))

(defn pop [stack]
  (rest stack))

(defn peek-stack [stack]
  (first stack))
```

**Explanation:**

- **`create-stack`**: Initializes an empty stack.
- **`push`**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **`pop`**: Removes the top element.
- **`peek-stack`**: Returns the top element without removing it.

#### Java Comparison

Java stacks are typically implemented using the `Stack` class or `ArrayDeque`. The Clojure version is more concise and leverages immutability.

```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push(1); // Push
stack.pop();   // Pop
stack.peek();  // Peek
```

### Heaps and Priority Queues

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property, making them ideal for implementing priority queues. In Clojure, heaps can be implemented using sorted maps or custom data structures.

#### Implementing Heaps in Clojure

A simple binary heap can be implemented using a vector to maintain the heap property.

```clojure
(defn create-heap []
  [])

(defn heapify-up [heap index]
  (let [parent-index (quot (dec index) 2)]
    (if (and (>= index 1) (< (heap index) (heap parent-index)))
      (recur (assoc heap index (heap parent-index)
                         parent-index (heap index))
             parent-index)
      heap)))

(defn insert-heap [heap element]
  (heapify-up (conj heap element) (dec (count heap))))

(defn heapify-down [heap index]
  (let [left-child (inc (* 2 index))
        right-child (+ 2 (* 2 index))
        smallest (reduce (fn [smallest child]
                           (if (and (< child (count heap))
                                    (< (heap child) (heap smallest)))
                             child
                             smallest))
                         index
                         [left-child right-child])]
    (if (not= smallest index)
      (recur (assoc heap index (heap smallest)
                         smallest (heap index))
             smallest)
      heap)))

(defn remove-min [heap]
  (let [last-index (dec (count heap))]
    (heapify-down (assoc heap 0 (heap last-index)) 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

- **`create-heap`**: Initializes an empty heap.
- **`heapify-up`**: Ensures the heap property is maintained when adding an element.
- **`insert-heap`**: Adds an element to the heap.
- **`heapify-down`**: Maintains the heap property when removing the root.
- **`remove-min`**: Removes the minimum element (root) from the heap.

#### Java Comparison

Java's `PriorityQueue` class provides a built-in implementation of a heap. The Clojure version offers more control and customization.

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<>();
heap.add(1); // Insert
heap.poll(); // Remove Min
```

### Use Cases

- **Queues**: Useful in task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and buffering data streams.
- **Stacks**: Ideal for depth-first search, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
- **Heaps**: Essential for implementing priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm, and event simulation.

### Visual Aids

To better understand these data structures, let's visualize the flow of data through these collections.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Queue] --> B[Enqueue]
    B --> C[Dequeue]
    C --> D[Peek]

    E[Stack] --> F[Push]
    F --> G[Pop]
    G --> H[Peek]

    I[Heap] --> J[Insert]
    J --> K[Remove Min]
    K --> L[Heapify]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Queue**: Shows the operations of enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
- **Stack**: Illustrates push, pop, and peek operations.
