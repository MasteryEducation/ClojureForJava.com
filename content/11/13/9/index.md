## 13.9 Dealing with Shared Resources

In the realm of concurrent programming, managing shared resources is a critical challenge. Whether you're dealing with files, databases, or network connections, ensuring that these resources are accessed safely and efficiently is paramount. In this section, we will explore various strategies to handle shared resources in Clojure, drawing parallels with Java where applicable.

### Resource Contention

**Resource contention** occurs when multiple threads or processes attempt to access a shared resource simultaneously, leading to potential conflicts or performance bottlenecks. In Java, this is often managed using synchronization primitives like `synchronized` blocks or `ReentrantLock`. Clojure, with its emphasis on immutability and functional programming, offers different paradigms for handling such scenarios.

#### Challenges of Managing Shared Resources

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring that shared resources remain in a consistent state despite concurrent access.
2. **Deadlocks**: Avoiding situations where two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other.
3. **Performance**: Minimizing the overhead introduced by synchronization mechanisms.
4. **Scalability**: Ensuring that the application can handle increased load without degradation in performance.

### Locking Mechanisms

While Clojure encourages immutability, there are scenarios where mutable state is necessary, particularly when dealing with shared resources. In such cases, locking mechanisms can be employed to ensure safe access.

#### When to Use Locks

Locks should be used when:

- **Mutable State**: You have mutable state that needs to be accessed by multiple threads.
- **Critical Sections**: There are critical sections of code that must not be executed concurrently by multiple threads.

#### How to Use Locks in Clojure

Clojure provides several constructs for managing state and concurrency, including `atoms`, `refs`, and `agents`. These constructs abstract away the complexity of locks, but understanding how they work under the hood is beneficial.

##### Atoms

Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state. They are ideal for scenarios where you need to manage a single piece of state that can be updated atomically.

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))

;; Increment the counter atomically
(swap! counter inc)
```

##### Refs and Software Transactional Memory (STM)

Refs are used for coordinated, synchronous updates to multiple pieces of state. They leverage Clojure's Software Transactional Memory (STM) to ensure consistency.

```clojure
(def account1 (ref 100))
(def account2 (ref 200))

;; Transfer money between accounts
(dosync
  (alter account1 - 50)
  (alter account2 + 50))
```

##### Agents

Agents are designed for managing asynchronous state changes. They are useful when you want to perform updates in the background without blocking the main thread.

```clojure
(def log-agent (agent []))

;; Add a log entry asynchronously
(send log-agent conj "New log entry")
```

### Connection Pools

Managing database connections or network sockets efficiently is crucial in any application. Connection pooling is a technique used to maintain a pool of connections that can be reused, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.

#### Introducing Connection Pools

Connection pools allow multiple threads to share a set of pre-established connections, improving performance and resource utilization. In Java, libraries like HikariCP or Apache Commons DBCP are commonly used. In Clojure, you can leverage these Java libraries directly or use Clojure-specific libraries like `c3p0`.

#### Implementing Connection Pools in Clojure

Here's an example of setting up a connection pool using `c3p0` in Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec
  {:classname "org.postgresql.Driver"
   :subprotocol "postgresql"
   :subname "//localhost:5432/mydb"
   :user "user"
   :password "password"
   :datasource (doto (com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource.)
                 (.setDriverClass "org.postgresql.Driver")
                 (.setJdbcUrl "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb")
                 (.setUser "user")
                 (.setPassword "password")
                 (.setMinPoolSize 5)
                 (.setMaxPoolSize 20))})

;; Use the connection pool
(jdbc/query db-spec ["SELECT * FROM my_table"])
```

### Managing Side Effects

In functional programming, side effects are changes in state or interactions with the outside world that occur during the execution of a function. Managing side effects in a thread-safe manner is crucial for building reliable concurrent applications.

#### Strategies for Handling Side Effects

1. **Isolation**: Encapsulate side effects within specific functions or modules, minimizing their impact on the rest of the application.
2. **Immutability**: Use immutable data structures to prevent unintended modifications.
3. **Concurrency Primitives**: Leverage Clojure's concurrency primitives (`atoms`, `refs`, `agents`) to manage state changes safely.

#### Example: Safely Managing Shared Resources

Let's consider a scenario where we need to log messages to a file from multiple threads. We'll use an `agent` to manage the file writing asynchronously.

```clojure
(def log-agent (agent (java.io.FileWriter. "log.txt" true)))

(defn log-message [message]
  (send log-agent
        (fn [writer]
          (.write writer (str message "\n"))
          writer)))

;; Log messages from different threads
(log-message "Thread 1: Starting process")
(log-message "Thread 2: Process completed")
```

### Visualizing Concurrency Models

To better understand how Clojure's concurrency models work, let's visualize the flow of data through these constructs.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Atom: Synchronous Updates];
    A --> C[Ref: Coordinated Updates];
    A --> D[Agent: Asynchronous Updates];
    B --> E[State Updated Atomically];
    C --> F[State Updated in Transaction];
    D --> G[State Updated Asynchronously];
```

**Diagram Description**: This flowchart illustrates the different concurrency models in Clojure. Atoms handle synchronous updates, refs manage coordinated updates using transactions, and agents perform asynchronous updates.
