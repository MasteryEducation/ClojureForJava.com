## 11.1 Functional Approaches to Error Handling

In functional programming, error handling is approached with a focus on maintaining the purity of functions and ensuring predictable behavior. This section will guide you through the principles of error handling in functional programming, specifically in Clojure, and how it contrasts with traditional Java error handling techniques.

### Error Handling Principles

Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions—functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. This predictability is crucial for error handling, as it allows developers to reason about their code more effectively.

#### Returning vs. Throwing Errors

In Java, error handling often involves throwing exceptions, which can disrupt the flow of a program and lead to unpredictable behavior if not managed correctly. In contrast, functional programming encourages returning error values, allowing errors to be handled explicitly and predictably.

**Java Example:**

```java
public int divide(int numerator, int denominator) {
    if (denominator == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero");
    }
    return numerator / denominator;
}
```

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(defn divide [numerator denominator]
  (if (zero? denominator)
    {:error "Division by zero"}
    {:result (/ numerator denominator)}))
```

In the Clojure example, the function returns a map with either an `:error` or `:result` key, allowing the caller to handle the error explicitly.

### Either/Maybe Monads

Monads are a powerful concept in functional programming that can be used to handle errors gracefully. The `Either` and `Maybe` monads are particularly useful for error handling.

#### Either Monad

The `Either` monad represents a computation that can result in either a success (`Right`) or a failure (`Left`). This allows errors to be handled in a functional way without throwing exceptions.

**Clojure Example Using Either:**

```clojure
(require '[cats.monad.either :as either])

(defn safe-divide [numerator denominator]
  (if (zero? denominator)
    (either/left "Division by zero")
    (either/right (/ numerator denominator))))

(defn process-division [numerator denominator]
  (either/branch (safe-divide numerator denominator)
                 (fn [error] (println "Error:" error))
                 (fn [result] (println "Result:" result))))
```

In this example, `safe-divide` returns an `Either` monad, and `process-division` uses `either/branch` to handle the error or success case.

#### Maybe Monad

The `Maybe` monad is used to represent computations that might fail, returning `Nothing` in case of failure and `Just` in case of success.

**Clojure Example Using Maybe:**

```clojure
(require '[cats.monad.maybe :as maybe])

(defn safe-root [x]
  (if (neg? x)
    (maybe/nothing)
    (maybe/just (Math/sqrt x))))

(defn process-root [x]
  (maybe/maybe (safe-root x)
               (fn [result] (println "Square root:" result))
               (println "Cannot compute square root of a negative number")))
```

Here, `safe-root` returns a `Maybe` monad, and `process-root` handles the `Nothing` or `Just` case.

### Examples of Functional Error Handling

Let's explore some practical examples of how functional error handling can be implemented in Clojure.

#### Example 1: File Reading

Consider a function that reads a file and returns its contents. In a functional approach, we can return an error value if the file cannot be read.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(defn read-file [filename]
  (try
    {:result (slurp filename)}
    (catch Exception e
      {:error (.getMessage e)})))

(defn process-file [filename]
  (let [{:keys [result error]} (read-file filename)]
    (if error
      (println "Error reading file:" error)
      (println "File contents:" result))))
```

In this example, `read-file` returns a map with either `:result` or `:error`, and `process-file` handles the error or success case.

#### Example 2: API Call

Suppose we have a function that makes an API call and returns the response. We can use the `Either` monad to handle potential errors.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(require '[clj-http.client :as client])
(require '[cats.monad.either :as either])

(defn fetch-data [url]
  (try
    (either/right (client/get url))
    (catch Exception e
      (either/left (.getMessage e)))))

(defn process-api-call [url]
  (either/branch (fetch-data url)
                 (fn [error] (println "API call failed:" error))
                 (fn [response] (println "API response:" (:body response)))))
```

Here, `fetch-data` returns an `Either` monad, and `process-api-call` handles the error or success case.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data through monads, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Perform Operation];
    B --> C{Success?};
    C -->|Yes| D[Return Success Value];
    C -->|No| E[Return Error Value];
    D --> F[Handle Success];
    E --> G[Handle Error];
    F --> H[End];
    G --> H;
```

1. Modify the `read-file` function to return a `Maybe` monad instead of a map.
2. Implement a function that uses the `Either` monad to handle errors in a database query.
3. Create a flowchart similar to Figure 1 for a different error handling scenario.
