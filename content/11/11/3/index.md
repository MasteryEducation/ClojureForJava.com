## 11.3 Using `clojure.spec` for Data Validation

In the world of software development, ensuring data integrity is paramount. As experienced Java developers, you are likely familiar with Java's type system and validation frameworks like Hibernate Validator. In Clojure, `clojure.spec` offers a powerful and flexible way to specify the structure of data and functions, providing robust data validation capabilities. In this section, we will explore how to leverage `clojure.spec` to validate data, ensuring your applications are both reliable and maintainable.

### Introduction to `clojure.spec`

`clojure.spec` is a library that allows you to describe the shape of your data and functions. It provides a way to define specifications (specs) for data structures, validate data against these specs, and instrument functions to automatically check their arguments. This approach not only helps in catching errors early but also serves as documentation for the expected data structures and function contracts.

#### Key Features of `clojure.spec`

- **Declarative Data Specifications**: Define the expected structure of data using a concise and expressive syntax.
- **Validation and Conformance**: Validate data against specs and transform data to conform to the specified structure.
- **Function Instrumentation**: Automatically check function arguments against their specs, ensuring they meet the expected criteria.
- **Generative Testing**: Use specs to generate test data, enhancing the robustness of your test suite.

### Writing Specs

To begin using `clojure.spec`, you need to define specs for your data structures. Specs are defined using the `s/def` function, which associates a spec with a keyword.

#### Defining Basic Specs

Let's start by defining a simple spec for a username, which should be a non-empty string.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])

(s/def ::username (s/and string? not-empty))
```

In this example, `::username` is a namespaced keyword, and the spec ensures that the value is a string and not empty.

#### Specifying Data Structures

For more complex data structures, such as maps, you can use `s/keys` to specify the required and optional keys.

```clojure
(s/def ::user
  (s/keys :req [::username]
          :opt [::email ::age]))
```

Here, we define a `::user` spec that requires a `::username` and optionally includes `::email` and `::age`.

#### Nested Data Structures

Specs can be nested to describe complex data structures. For instance, if a user has an address, you can define a spec for the address and include it in the user spec.

```clojure
(s/def ::street string?)
(s/def ::city string?)
(s/def ::address
  (s/keys :req [::street ::city]))

(s/def ::user
  (s/keys :req [::username ::address]
          :opt [::email ::age]))
```

### Validating Data

Once you have defined your specs, you can validate data against them using `s/valid?` and `s/conform`.

#### Using `s/valid?`

The `s/valid?` function checks if a piece of data conforms to a spec, returning `true` or `false`.

```clojure
(def user-data {:username "jdoe" :address {:street "123 Elm St" :city "Springfield"}})

(s/valid? ::user user-data)
;; => true
```

If the data does not conform, `s/valid?` returns `false`.

```clojure
(def invalid-user-data {:username "" :address {:street "123 Elm St" :city "Springfield"}})

(s/valid? ::user invalid-user-data)
;; => false
```

#### Using `s/conform`

The `s/conform` function not only checks if data conforms to a spec but also returns a conformed version of the data. If the data does not conform, it returns `:clojure.spec.alpha/invalid`.

```clojure
(s/conform ::user user-data)
;; => {:username "jdoe", :address {:street "123 Elm St", :city "Springfield"}}

(s/conform ::user invalid-user-data)
;; => :clojure.spec.alpha/invalid
```

### Instrumenting Functions

Function instrumentation is a powerful feature of `clojure.spec` that allows you to automatically validate function arguments against their specs. This ensures that functions are called with the correct types and structures of data.

#### Defining Function Specs

To instrument a function, you need to define specs for its arguments and return value using `s/fdef`.

```clojure
(s/fdef greet
  :args (s/cat :username ::username)
  :ret string?)

(defn greet [username]
  (str "Hello, " username "!"))
```

#### Enabling Instrumentation

To enable instrumentation, use the `stest/instrument` function from the `clojure.spec.test.alpha` namespace.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest])

(stest/instrument `greet)
```

With instrumentation enabled, calling `greet` with an invalid argument will result in an error.

```clojure
(greet "")
;; Throws an error because the username is not valid
```

### Practical Example: Validating User Data

Let's put everything together in a practical example. Suppose we have a function that registers a user, and we want to ensure that the user data is valid.

```clojure
(s/def ::email (s/and string? #(re-matches #".+@.+\..+" %)))
(s/def ::age (s/and int? #(>= % 18)))

(s/fdef register-user
  :args (s/cat :user ::user)
  :ret string?)

(defn register-user [user]
  (str "User " (::username user) " registered successfully."))

(stest/instrument `register-user)

(def valid-user {:username "jdoe"
                 :email "jdoe@example.com"
                 :age 30
                 :address {:street "123 Elm St" :city "Springfield"}})

(register-user valid-user)
;; => "User jdoe registered successfully."

(def invalid-user {:username ""
                   :email "invalid-email"
                   :age 17
                   :address {:street "123 Elm St" :city "Springfield"}})

(register-user invalid-user)
;; Throws an error due to invalid user data
```

### Visualizing Data Validation Flow

To better understand how data flows through the validation process, let's visualize it using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    A[Define Specs] --> B[Validate Data];
    B --> C{Data Valid?};
    C -->|Yes| D[Process Data];
    C -->|No| E[Return Error];
    D --> F[Return Success];
```
