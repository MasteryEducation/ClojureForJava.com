## 5.6 Currying and Partial Application

In the realm of functional programming, **currying** and **partial application** are powerful techniques that allow developers to create more modular, reusable, and expressive code. These concepts, while rooted in mathematical functions, have practical applications in programming languages like Clojure. As experienced Java developers transitioning to Clojure, understanding these techniques will enhance your ability to write clean and efficient functional code.

### Understanding Currying

**Currying** is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This concept is named after the mathematician Haskell Curry. Currying allows functions to be applied partially, enabling more flexible function composition and reuse.

#### Currying in Theory

In a curried function, each function returns another function that takes the next argument. This continues until all arguments are supplied, at which point the final result is computed.

**Example in Mathematics:**

Consider a function `f(x, y, z) = x + y + z`. In curried form, this becomes:

- `f(x) = (y) => (z) => x + y + z`

This transformation allows us to apply arguments one at a time.

#### Currying in Clojure

While Clojure does not natively support currying in the same way as some other functional languages like Haskell, we can achieve similar behavior using closures and higher-order functions.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(defn curried-add [x]
  (fn [y]
    (fn [z]
      (+ x y z))))

;; Usage
(def add-five (curried-add 5))
(def add-five-and-ten (add-five 10))
(def result (add-five-and-ten 15)) ; result is 30
```

In this example, `curried-add` is a function that returns another function, which in turn returns another function. This allows us to apply arguments one at a time.

### Partial Application

**Partial application** involves fixing a few arguments of a function, producing another function of smaller arity. This is particularly useful when you want to preset some parameters of a function and reuse it with different remaining arguments.

#### Partial Application in Clojure

Clojure provides the `partial` function to facilitate partial application. This function takes a function and some arguments, returning a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

**Clojure Example:**

```clojure
(defn greet [greeting name]
  (str greeting ", " name "!"))

(def say-hello (partial greet "Hello"))

;; Usage
(say-hello "Alice") ; "Hello, Alice!"
(say-hello "Bob")   ; "Hello, Bob!"
```

In this example, `say-hello` is a partially applied function that presets the `greeting` argument to "Hello". We can then use it to greet different people.

### Comparing Currying and Partial Application

While both currying and partial application involve breaking down functions into smaller parts, they differ in their approach and use cases:

- **Currying**: Transforms a function into a sequence of unary functions. It is more about the transformation of function signatures.
- **Partial Application**: Fixes some arguments of a function, creating a new function with fewer arguments. It is more about reusing functions with preset parameters.

### Practical Applications

Currying and partial application can simplify code in various scenarios, such as:

- **Configuration Parameters**: Preset configuration values for functions that require them.
- **Event Handlers**: Create event handlers with specific context or state.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Build reusable components in data processing workflows.

### Using `partial` in Clojure

The `partial` function in Clojure is a versatile tool for creating partially applied functions. Let's explore some examples to see how it can be used effectively.

#### Example: Presetting Configuration Parameters

Suppose we have a function that logs messages with a specific log level:

```clojure
(defn log-message [level message]
  (println (str "[" level "] " message)))

(def info-log (partial log-message "INFO"))
(def error-log (partial log-message "ERROR"))

;; Usage
(info-log "System started") ; [INFO] System started
(error-log "An error occurred") ; [ERROR] An error occurred
```

In this example, `info-log` and `error-log` are partially applied functions that preset the log level, allowing us to log messages with different levels easily.

#### Example: Event Handlers

Consider a scenario where we need to handle events with specific context:

```clojure
(defn handle-event [context event]
  (println (str "Handling " event " in context " context)))

(def user-event-handler (partial handle-event "User"))

;; Usage
(user-event-handler "Login") ; Handling Login in context User
(user-event-handler "Logout") ; Handling Logout in context User
```

Here, `user-event-handler` is a partially applied function that presets the context to "User", making it easy to handle user-related events.

### Visualizing Currying and Partial Application

To better understand the flow of data through curried and partially applied functions, let's visualize these concepts using diagrams.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Function f(x, y, z)] --> B[Curried Function f(x)]
    B --> C[Function f(y)]
    C --> D[Function f(z)]
    D --> E[Result]

    F[Function g(x, y)] --> G[Partial Application g(x)]
    G --> H[Function g(y)]
    H --> I[Result]
```

**Diagram Explanation:**

- **Curried Function Flow**: The function `f(x, y, z)` is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- **Partial Application Flow**: The function `g(x, y)` is partially applied with one argument, creating a new function that takes the remaining argument.

### Encouraging Experimentation

Now that we've explored currying and partial application, let's encourage you to experiment with these concepts. Try modifying the examples provided, or create your own functions to see how currying and partial application can simplify your code.

#### Try It Yourself

1. **Modify the `greet` function** to include a time of day (e.g., "Good morning").
2. **Create a curried version** of a function that multiplies three numbers.
3. **Use `partial` to preset** a discount rate in a pricing function.
