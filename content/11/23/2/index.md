## 23.2 Automating Builds with `Leiningen` and `deps.edn`

In the world of software development, automating builds is crucial for maintaining efficiency, consistency, and reliability. For Clojure developers, two primary tools facilitate this process: [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and the Clojure CLI tools with `deps.edn`. Both tools offer unique features and capabilities, allowing developers to manage dependencies, automate tasks, and streamline their build processes. In this section, we will delve into the specifics of each tool, compare their functionalities, and provide practical examples to help you automate your Clojure projects effectively.

### Build Tooling Choices

Before diving into the specifics of each tool, let's compare Leiningen and the Clojure CLI tools (`deps.edn`) to understand their roles in Clojure project automation.

#### Leiningen

Leiningen is a build automation tool specifically designed for Clojure projects. It simplifies the process of managing dependencies, building projects, and running tasks. Leiningen uses a `project.clj` file to define project configurations, dependencies, and tasks. It is known for its extensive plugin ecosystem, which allows developers to extend its functionality with ease.

#### Clojure CLI and `deps.edn`

The Clojure CLI tools, introduced more recently, provide a lightweight alternative to Leiningen. They use a `deps.edn` file to manage dependencies and execute build tasks. The Clojure CLI tools focus on simplicity and flexibility, allowing developers to define their own build processes using shell scripts or other tools.

### Using Leiningen

Leiningen is a powerful tool for automating Clojure builds. Let's explore how to define project configurations, manage dependencies, and automate tasks using a `project.clj` file.

#### Defining Project Configurations

A `project.clj` file is the heart of a Leiningen project. It contains all the necessary configurations for your project, including its name, version, dependencies, and build tasks. Here's a basic example of a `project.clj` file:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A sample Clojure application"
  :url "http://example.com/my-clojure-app"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

- **Project Metadata**: The `defproject` macro defines the project's name, version, description, and URL.
- **Dependencies**: The `:dependencies` vector lists the libraries your project depends on.
- **Main Namespace**: The `:main` key specifies the main namespace to run when executing the project.
- **Profiles**: The `:profiles` map allows you to define different build configurations, such as an `uberjar` profile for creating standalone JAR files.

#### Managing Dependencies

Leiningen makes dependency management straightforward. You can add dependencies to the `:dependencies` vector in your `project.clj` file. Leiningen will automatically download and manage these dependencies for you.

#### Automating Tasks

Leiningen provides several built-in tasks, such as `lein run`, `lein test`, and `lein uberjar`. You can also define custom tasks using plugins or by writing your own Leiningen tasks.

### Clojure CLI and `deps.edn`

The Clojure CLI tools offer a more flexible approach to build automation. Let's explore how to manage dependencies and execute build tasks using a `deps.edn` file.

#### Managing Dependencies

A `deps.edn` file defines your project's dependencies and paths. Here's an example of a `deps.edn` file:

```clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        ring/ring-core {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}}}
```

- **Dependencies**: The `:deps` map lists the libraries your project depends on, using Maven coordinates.

#### Executing Build Tasks

The Clojure CLI tools do not have built-in task automation like Leiningen. Instead, you can use shell scripts or other tools to define your build process. For example, you can create a `build.sh` script to automate tasks like running tests or packaging your application.

### Custom Tasks and Plugins

Both Leiningen and the Clojure CLI tools allow you to extend their functionality with custom tasks and plugins.

#### Leiningen Plugins

Leiningen has a rich ecosystem of plugins that can be used to extend its functionality. You can add plugins to your `project.clj` file and use them to automate tasks like code linting, testing, and deployment.

#### Clojure CLI Custom Tasks

With the Clojure CLI tools, you can define custom tasks using shell scripts or other tools. This approach provides flexibility, allowing you to tailor your build process to your specific needs.

### Automation Examples

Let's explore some practical examples of automating tasks with Leiningen and the Clojure CLI tools.

#### Code Linting

You can automate code linting using the `eastwood` plugin for Leiningen or by using a shell script with the Clojure CLI tools.

**Leiningen Example:**

```clojure
;; Add the eastwood plugin to your project.clj
:plugins [[jonase/eastwood "0.3.5"]]

;; Run the eastwood linter
lein eastwood
```

**Clojure CLI Example:**

Create a `lint.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {jonase/eastwood {:mvn/version "0.3.5"}}}' -m eastwood.lint
```

#### Testing

Automate testing using the `lein test` task or a shell script with the Clojure CLI tools.

**Leiningen Example:**

```bash
lein test
```

**Clojure CLI Example:**

Create a `test.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
clj -A:test
```

#### Packaging

Create standalone JAR files using the `lein uberjar` task or a shell script with the Clojure CLI tools.

**Leiningen Example:**

```bash
lein uberjar
```

**Clojure CLI Example:**

Create a `package.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
clj -A:uberjar
```

#### Deployment

Automate deployment using plugins or custom scripts. For example, you can use the `lein deploy` task or a shell script with the Clojure CLI tools.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the flow of data and tasks in Clojure build automation, let's look at a diagram illustrating the process.
