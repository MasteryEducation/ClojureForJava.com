## 21.8 Automating Deployment with Clojure Tools

In the fast-paced world of software development, automating deployment processes is not just a luxury but a necessity. Automation ensures consistency, reduces human error, and accelerates the delivery of software to production environments. For developers transitioning from Java to Clojure, understanding how to leverage Clojure's ecosystem for deployment automation can significantly enhance productivity and reliability.

### Importance of Automation

Automating deployment processes is critical for several reasons:

- **Consistency**: Automated deployments ensure that the same process is followed every time, reducing the risk of human error.
- **Speed**: Automation speeds up the deployment process, allowing for more frequent releases and faster feedback loops.
- **Reliability**: Automated processes are less prone to errors compared to manual deployments, leading to more stable production environments.
- **Scalability**: As applications grow, manual deployment becomes impractical. Automation scales with your application, handling complex deployments effortlessly.

### Build Tools: Leiningen and Clojure CLI

Clojure offers powerful tools for managing dependencies, building projects, and automating tasks. Two primary tools in the Clojure ecosystem are Leiningen and the Clojure CLI with `deps.edn`.

#### Leiningen

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is a popular build automation tool for Clojure. It simplifies project management, dependency resolution, and task automation.

**Key Features of Leiningen:**

- **Dependency Management**: Define dependencies in a `project.clj` file, and Leiningen handles the rest.
- **Task Automation**: Automate common tasks like testing, building, and deploying with custom tasks.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend functionality with a wide range of plugins.

**Example `project.clj`:**

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A sample Clojure application"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]]
  :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
  :target-path "target/%s"
  :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
```

#### Clojure CLI and `deps.edn`

The Clojure CLI tools provide a lightweight alternative to Leiningen, focusing on simplicity and flexibility.

**Key Features of Clojure CLI:**

- **Dependency Management**: Use `deps.edn` to specify dependencies and aliases.
- **Script Execution**: Run Clojure scripts directly from the command line.
- **Tooling Integration**: Easily integrate with other tools and libraries.

**Example `deps.edn`:**

```clojure
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}
 :aliases {:run {:main-opts ["-m" "my-clojure-app.core"]}}}
```

### Deployment Scripts with Tools.build

Writing deployment scripts in Clojure can be achieved using libraries like [Tools.build](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build). This library provides a programmatic way to define build processes, making it easy to automate complex deployment tasks.

**Example Deployment Script:**

```clojure
(ns build
  (:require [clojure.tools.build.api :as b]))

(defn clean [_]
  (b/delete {:path "target"}))

(defn uberjar [_]
  (b/uber {:class-dir "classes"
           :uber-file "target/my-clojure-app.jar"
           :basis (b/create-basis {:project "deps.edn"})
           :main 'my-clojure-app.core}))

(defn deploy [_]
  (clean nil)
  (uberjar nil)
  ;; Add deployment logic here, e.g., uploading to a server
  (println "Deployment complete."))
```

### Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and GitHub Actions

Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline. This ensures that your software is always in a deployable state.

#### Setting Up Jenkins

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is a widely used open-source automation server that supports building, deploying, and automating any project.

**Jenkins Pipeline Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'lein uberjar'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'lein test'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'scp target/my-clojure-app.jar user@server:/path/to/deploy'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Using GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) provides a powerful platform for automating workflows directly from your GitHub repository.

**GitHub Actions Workflow Example:**

```yaml
name: Clojure CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Clojure
      uses: DeLaGuardo/setup-clojure@v1
      with:
        cli: 'tools-deps'

    - name: Build with deps.edn
      run: clojure -T:build uberjar

    - name: Test
      run: clojure -M:test

    - name: Deploy
      run: scp target/my-clojure-app.jar user@server:/path/to/deploy
```

### Example Pipeline: From Code Commit to Production Deployment

Let's walk through an example pipeline that takes code from commit to production deployment using GitHub Actions.

1. **Code Commit**: A developer pushes code changes to the main branch of the repository.
2. **Build and Test**: GitHub Actions triggers a workflow that builds the project and runs tests.
3. **Package**: The application is packaged into an uberjar.
4. **Deploy**: The packaged application is deployed to a production server.

**Pipeline Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Code Commit] --> B[Build and Test];
    B --> C[Package Application];
    C --> D[Deploy to Production];
    D --> E[Production Environment];
```
