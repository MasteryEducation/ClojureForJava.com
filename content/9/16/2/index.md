## 16.2 Writing Basic Macros

In the realm of functional programming with Clojure, macros are a powerful tool that allow developers to perform metaprogramming—writing code that writes code. This section will guide you through the process of writing basic macros in Clojure, providing a strong foundation for leveraging this advanced feature to create more expressive and efficient code.

### Defining Macros

Macros in Clojure are defined using the `defmacro` construct. Unlike functions, macros operate on the unevaluated code, allowing you to manipulate and transform code before it is executed. This capability is akin to creating new language constructs, enabling you to extend the language in ways that are not possible with functions alone.

#### Using `defmacro`

To define a macro, use the `defmacro` keyword followed by the macro's name and a parameter list. The macro body consists of code that generates the desired output form. Here's a simple example of a macro that adds two numbers:

```clojure
(defmacro add [a b]
  `(+ ~a ~b))
```

In this example, the macro `add` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and produces code that adds them together. The backtick (`` ` ``) is used for syntax quoting, which we'll explore in detail next.

### Quoting and Syntax

Quoting is a crucial concept in macro writing, as it determines how expressions are treated. In Clojure, there are several types of quoting:

- **Simple Quoting (`'`)**: Prevents evaluation of the expression.
- **Syntax Quoting (`` ` ``)**: Similar to simple quoting but resolves symbols to their fully-qualified names and allows unquoting.

#### Simple Quoting

Simple quoting is used to prevent the evaluation of an expression. For example:

```clojure
'(1 2 3) ; => (1 2 3)
```

In this case, the list `(1 2 3)` is not evaluated and is returned as-is.

#### Syntax Quoting

Syntax quoting is more powerful and is often used in macros. It not only prevents evaluation but also resolves symbols to their fully-qualified names, ensuring that the code generated by the macro is correctly scoped. Syntax quoting is done using the backtick (`` ` ``), and unquoting within a syntax-quoted expression is done using the tilde (`~`).

Consider the following example:

```clojure
(defmacro greet [name]
  `(println "Hello," ~name))
```

Here, the `greet` macro uses syntax quoting to construct a form that prints a greeting. The `~name` is unquoted, allowing the macro to insert the value of `name` into the generated code.

### Macro Arguments

One of the distinguishing features of macros is that they receive unevaluated code as their arguments. This allows macros to manipulate the code itself, rather than just the values produced by the code.

#### Handling Unevaluated Code

When writing macros, it's important to remember that the arguments are passed as raw code forms. You can manipulate these forms to produce the desired output. For example, consider a macro that implements a simple `when` construct:

```clojure
(defmacro my-when [condition & body]
  `(if ~condition
     (do ~@body)))
```

In this macro, `my-when` takes a condition and a body of expressions. The `& body` syntax collects all remaining arguments into a list, which is then spliced into the `do` form using `~@`.

### Examples of Macros

Let's explore some practical examples to solidify your understanding of macros.

#### Example 1: Implementing a `when` Macro

The `my-when` macro we introduced earlier is a simplified version of the built-in `when` macro. It evaluates the body only if the condition is true:

```clojure
(defmacro my-when [condition & body]
  `(if ~condition
     (do ~@body)))

;; Usage
(my-when true
  (println "This will print")
  (println "This too"))

(my-when false
  (println "This will not print"))
```

#### Example 2: Creating a Debugging Macro

Macros can be used to inject debugging information into your code. Here's a macro that logs the value of an expression along with its result:

```clojure
(defmacro debug [expr]
  `(let [result# ~expr]
     (println "Debug:" '~expr "=" result#)
     result#))

;; Usage
(debug (+ 1 2))
```

In this example, the `debug` macro evaluates the expression, prints it along with its result, and then returns the result. The `#` character is used to generate a unique symbol, ensuring that the temporary variable `result#` does not clash with other symbols.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the examples above:

- **Modify the `my-when` macro** to include an `else` branch.
- **Enhance the `debug` macro** to log the time taken to evaluate the expression.

### Visual Aids

To better understand how macros transform code, let's visualize the process using a simple flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Define Macro] --> B[Receive Unevaluated Code];
    B --> C[Transform Code];
    C --> D[Generate Output Form];
    D --> E[Evaluate Transformed Code];
```

### Knowledge Check

To ensure you've grasped the concepts, here's a quick exercise:

- **Exercise**: Write a macro `unless` that works like an inverted `if`, executing the body only if the condition is false.

### Encouraging Engagement

Writing macros can seem daunting at first, but with practice, you'll find them to be a powerful tool in your Clojure toolkit. Embrace the challenge, and remember that each macro you write brings you closer to mastering Clojure's metaprogramming capabilities.
