## 18.8 Mocking and Stubbing in Clojure Tests

In the realm of software testing, particularly in functional programming with Clojure, understanding how to effectively use mocks and stubs is crucial. These techniques allow us to isolate the unit of work we are testing, ensuring that our tests are both reliable and meaningful. In this section, we will delve into the concepts of mocking and stubbing, explore the use of `with-redefs` for function redefinition, and discuss strategies for testing side effects. We will also examine the limitations of overusing mocks and explore alternatives such as protocols and dependency injection.

### Understanding Mocks and Stubs

**Mocks** and **stubs** are two common tools used in testing to simulate the behavior of complex systems or components that are not the primary focus of a test. 

- **Mocks** are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. They are used to verify interactions between components, allowing you to check if certain methods were called with expected parameters.

- **Stubs**, on the other hand, are used to provide predetermined responses to method calls. They are often simpler than mocks and do not record interactions.

#### When to Use Mocks and Stubs

- **Use Mocks** when you need to verify that certain interactions happen, such as ensuring a function is called with specific arguments.

- **Use Stubs** when you need to simulate responses from dependencies, such as returning a fixed value from a database query.

### `with-redefs` Usage

Clojure provides a powerful feature called `with-redefs` that allows you to temporarily redefine functions during the execution of a test. This can be particularly useful for stubbing out dependencies.

```clojure
(defn fetch-data []
  ;; Imagine this function makes a network call
  {:data "real data"})

(deftest test-fetch-data
  (with-redefs [fetch-data (fn [] {:data "stubbed data"})]
    (is (= {:data "stubbed data"} (fetch-data)))))
```

In the example above, `fetch-data` is redefined to return a stubbed response during the test. This allows us to test the behavior of code that depends on `fetch-data` without making an actual network call.

#### Key Points About `with-redefs`

- **Scope**: The redefinition is only in effect within the scope of the `with-redefs` block.
- **Thread Safety**: Be cautious when using `with-redefs` in concurrent tests as it affects global state.
- **Performance**: Using `with-redefs` can lead to performance overhead if overused, as it involves altering the function's definition at runtime.

### Testing Side Effects

Testing side effects in functional programming can be challenging due to the emphasis on pure functions. However, when side effects are necessary, such as logging or I/O operations, we can use mocks to verify interactions.

```clojure
(defn log-message [msg]
  ;; Imagine this logs to a file
  (println msg))

(deftest test-log-message
  (let [logged-messages (atom [])]
    (with-redefs [log-message (fn [msg] (swap! logged-messages conj msg))]
      (log-message "Test message")
      (is (= ["Test message"] @logged-messages)))))
```

In this example, we redefine `log-message` to capture messages in an atom, allowing us to verify that the correct message was logged.

#### Intercepting Function Calls

Intercepting function calls with mocks can help ensure that side effects occur as expected. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the side effect is an external interaction, such as sending an email or updating a database.

### Limitations of Overusing Mocks

While mocks and stubs are powerful tools, overusing them can lead to tests that are tightly coupled to the implementation details of the code. This can make tests brittle and difficult to maintain.

- **Tight Coupling**: Tests that rely heavily on mocks may need to be rewritten if the implementation changes, even if the behavior remains the same.
- **False Security**: Mocks can give a false sense of security by verifying interactions that are not relevant to the actual behavior being tested.
- **Complexity**: Overusing mocks can lead to complex test setups that are difficult to understand and maintain.

### Alternatives to Mocks and Stubs

To avoid the pitfalls of overusing mocks, consider these alternatives:

#### Using Protocols

Protocols in Clojure provide a way to define a set of functions that can be implemented by different types. This can be used to decouple your code from specific implementations, making it easier to substitute mocks or stubs in tests.

```clojure
(defprotocol DataFetcher
  (fetch [this]))

(defrecord RealFetcher []
  DataFetcher
  (fetch [_] {:data "real data"}))

(defrecord StubFetcher []
  DataFetcher
  (fetch [_] {:data "stubbed data"}))

(defn use-fetcher [fetcher]
  (fetch fetcher))

(deftest test-use-fetcher
  (let [stub-fetcher (->StubFetcher)]
    (is (= {:data "stubbed data"} (use-fetcher stub-fetcher)))))
```

#### Dependency Injection

Dependency injection involves passing dependencies as arguments to functions, rather than hardcoding them. This makes it easier to substitute different implementations in tests.

```clojure
(defn process-data [fetch-fn]
  (let [data (fetch-fn)]
    ;; Process data
    ))

(deftest test-process-data
  (let [stub-fetch-fn (fn [] {:data "stubbed data"})]
    (is (process-data stub-fetch-fn))))
```

By injecting `fetch-fn`, we can easily test `process-data` with different data sources.

### Conclusion

Mocking and stubbing are essential techniques in testing, allowing us to isolate units of work and verify interactions. However, it's important to use these tools judiciously to avoid tightly coupling tests to implementation details. By leveraging alternatives such as protocols and dependency injection, we can write more robust and maintainable tests.

Additionally, the article [Transitioning from OOP to Functional Programming](https://www.lispcast.com/oo-to-fp/) provides valuable insights for developers moving from Java OOP to Clojure.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the examples provided by modifying the stubbed responses or the interactions being tested. Consider how changes in implementation affect the tests and explore using protocols or dependency injection to decouple your tests from specific implementations.
