## 1.5 Setting Up the Clojure Development Environment

Embarking on your journey with Clojure requires a well-prepared development environment. This section will guide you through the installation of Clojure on various operating systems, introduce you to essential development tools, and walk you through your first REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) session. Let's dive in and set the stage for mastering functional programming with Clojure.

### Installing Clojure

Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable across different operating systems. We'll cover the installation process for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Installing Clojure on Windows

1. **Install Java**: Clojure requires Java. Download and install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

2. **Install Clojure CLI Tools**:
   - Download the Windows installer from the [Clojure website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a command prompt and run:
     ```shell
     clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
     ```
   - If you see the message, Clojure is installed correctly.

#### Installing Clojure on macOS

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't already, install Homebrew by following instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).

2. **Install Java**: Use Homebrew to install Java:
   ```shell
   brew install openjdk
   ```

3. **Install Clojure CLI Tools**:
   ```shell
   brew install clojure/tools/clojure
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```shell
     clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
     ```

#### Installing Clojure on Linux

1. **Install Java**: Use your package manager to install Java. For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
   ```

2. **Install Clojure CLI Tools**:
   - Follow the instructions on the [Clojure installation page](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) to download and run the installation script.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```shell
     clj -M -e "(println \"Clojure installed successfully!\")"
     ```

### Development Tools

Choosing the right development tools can significantly enhance your productivity. Let's explore some popular editors and IDEs for Clojure development.

#### Cursive for IntelliJ IDEA

[Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/) is a powerful plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, offering robust support for Clojure development.

- **Installation**: 
  - Install IntelliJ IDEA from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
  - Open IntelliJ IDEA, navigate to `Plugins`, search for "Cursive", and install it.

- **Features**:
  - Advanced code completion and navigation.
  - Integrated REPL support.
  - Seamless Leiningen and deps.edn project management.

#### Emacs with CIDER

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with [CIDER](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/) is a popular choice for developers who prefer a highly customizable editor.

- **Installation**:
  - Install Emacs using your package manager or download it from the [GNU Emacs website](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html).
  - Add CIDER to your Emacs configuration:
    ```emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
    (package-initialize)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'cider)
    ```

- **Features**:
  - Interactive REPL integration.
  - Debugging and profiling tools.
  - Rich editing capabilities with Paredit and Rainbow Delimiters.

### Leiningen and deps.edn

Managing Clojure projects efficiently is crucial. Let's look at two popular tools: Leiningen and the Clojure CLI tools with `deps.edn`.

#### Leiningen

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is a build automation tool for Clojure, similar to Maven for Java.

- **Installation**:
  - Download the `lein` script from the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/) and place it in your `PATH`.

- **Creating a New Project**:
  ```shell
  lein new app my-clojure-app
  cd my-clojure-app
  ```

- **Running the Project**:
  ```shell
  lein run
  ```

- **Managing Dependencies**: Add dependencies in the `project.clj` file.

#### Clojure CLI Tools and deps.edn

The Clojure CLI tools provide a lightweight alternative to Leiningen, using the `deps.edn` file for dependency management.

- **Creating a New Project**:
  ```shell
  mkdir my-clojure-app
  cd my-clojure-app
  echo '{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}}}' > deps.edn
  ```

- **Running the Project**:
  ```shell
  clj -M -m my-clojure-app.core
  ```

- **Managing Dependencies**: Edit the `deps.edn` file to add or update dependencies.

### First REPL Session

The REPL is a cornerstone of Clojure development, allowing for interactive coding and immediate feedback.

#### Starting a REPL

1. **Using Leiningen**:
   - Navigate to your project directory and run:
     ```shell
     lein repl
     ```

2. **Using Clojure CLI Tools**:
   - Simply run:
     ```shell
     clj
     ```

#### Running Simple Expressions

Once the REPL is running, you can start evaluating expressions.

- **Basic Arithmetic**:
  ```clojure
  (+ 1 2 3) ; => 6
  ```

- **Defining a Function**:
  ```clojure
  (defn greet [name]
    (str "Hello, " name "!"))

  (greet "Clojure") ; => "Hello, Clojure!"
  ```

- **Using Data Structures**:
  ```clojure
  (def fruits ["apple" "banana" "cherry"])
  (count fruits) ; => 3
  ```

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the REPL by modifying the examples above. Try adding new functions, manipulating data structures, or exploring Clojure's rich set of core functions.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the setup process, let's look at a diagram comparing Java and Clojure development environments:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Java Development Environment] -->|IDE| B(IntelliJ IDEA);
    A -->|Build Tool| C(Maven);
    A -->|Java REPL| D(JShell);
    E[Clojure Development Environment] -->|IDE| B;
    E -->|Build Tool| F(Leiningen);
    E -->|Clojure REPL| G(REPL);
```

**Diagram Explanation**: This diagram illustrates the parallel between Java and Clojure environments, highlighting IntelliJ IDEA as a common IDE, with Maven and Leiningen serving similar roles as build tools, and JShell and the Clojure REPL providing interactive environments.
