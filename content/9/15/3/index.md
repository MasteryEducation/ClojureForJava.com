## 15.3 Applying the Decorator Pattern Functionally

In the world of software design, patterns are essential tools that help developers solve recurring problems. One such pattern is the **Decorator Pattern**, which is widely used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to add behavior to objects dynamically. In this section, we will explore how to apply the decorator pattern functionally in Clojure, leveraging the power of higher-order functions and functional composition.

### Decorator Pattern Explained

The decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. In Java, this is typically achieved by creating a set of decorator classes that wrap the original class.

#### Java Example: Decorator Pattern

Let's consider a simple Java example to illustrate the decorator pattern:

```java
// Component interface
interface Coffee {
    String getDescription();
    double cost();
}

// Concrete component
class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee";
    }

    public double cost() {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

// Decorator class
abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = coffee;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }

    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost();
    }
}

// Concrete decorators
class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost() + 1.5;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    public double cost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// Usage
public class CoffeeShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee coffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        coffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
        coffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);

        System.out.println(coffee.getDescription() + " $" + coffee.cost());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Coffee` interface represents the component, and `SimpleCoffee` is a concrete component. The `CoffeeDecorator` is an abstract class that implements the `Coffee` interface and contains a reference to a `Coffee` object. `MilkDecorator` and `SugarDecorator` are concrete decorators that add additional behavior.

### Functional Approach

In functional programming, we can achieve similar behavior by composing functions. Instead of wrapping objects, we create higher-order functions that take a function as an argument and return a new function with enhanced behavior.

#### Clojure Example: Functional Decorator

Let's translate the Java example into a functional approach using Clojure:

```clojure
(defn simple-coffee []
  {:description "Simple Coffee"
   :cost 5.0})

(defn add-milk [coffee]
  (update coffee :description #(str % ", Milk"))
  (update coffee :cost #(+ % 1.5)))

(defn add-sugar [coffee]
  (update coffee :description #(str % ", Sugar"))
  (update coffee :cost #(+ % 0.5)))

(defn describe-coffee [coffee]
  (str (:description coffee) " $" (:cost coffee)))

;; Usage
(let [coffee (-> (simple-coffee)
                 add-milk
                 add-sugar)]
  (println (describe-coffee coffee)))
```

In this Clojure example, we define a `simple-coffee` function that returns a map representing the coffee. The `add-milk` and `add-sugar` functions are higher-order functions that take a coffee map as an argument and return a new coffee map with updated properties. We use the threading macro `->` to apply the decorators sequentially.

### Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They are a powerful tool in functional programming, enabling us to create flexible and reusable code.

#### Creating a Logging Decorator

Let's create a higher-order function that adds logging to any function:

```clojure
(defn with-logging [f]
  (fn [& args]
    (println "Calling function with arguments:" args)
    (let [result (apply f args)]
      (println "Function result:" result)
      result)))

;; Example function
(defn add [a b]
  (+ a b))

;; Decorated function
(def logged-add (with-logging add))

;; Usage
(logged-add 3 4)
```

In this example, `with-logging` is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and returns a new function that logs the arguments and result of `f`. We then apply this decorator to the `add` function.

### Examples

#### Caching Decorator

Caching is a common optimization technique that can be implemented as a decorator. Let's create a caching decorator in Clojure:

```clojure
(defn with-cache [f]
  (let [cache (atom {})]
    (fn [& args]
      (if-let [cached-result (get @cache args)]
        cached-result
        (let [result (apply f args)]
          (swap! cache assoc args result)
          result)))))

;; Example function
(defn expensive-computation [x]
  (Thread/sleep 1000) ; Simulate a long computation
  (* x x))

;; Decorated function
(def cached-expensive-computation (with-cache expensive-computation))

;; Usage
(time (cached-expensive-computation 5)) ; First call, takes time
(time (cached-expensive-computation 5)) ; Second call, returns cached result
```

The `with-cache` function creates a cache using an atom. It checks if the result for the given arguments is already cached; if not, it computes the result, caches it, and returns it.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the transformation from Java's decorator pattern to Clojure's functional approach, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Java Class] --> B[Decorator Class]
  B --> C[Concrete Decorator]
  C --> D[Enhanced Object]
  E[Clojure Function] --> F[Higher-Order Function]
  F --> G[Enhanced Function]
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the conceptual shift from Java's class-based decorator pattern to Clojure's function-based approach. In Java, decorators are implemented as classes that wrap other classes, while in Clojure, decorators are higher-order functions that enhance other functions.
