## 19.2 Refactoring Loops into Recursions

Refactoring loops into recursions is a fundamental step in embracing functional programming, especially when transitioning from an object-oriented language like Java to Clojure. In this section, we will explore how to transform traditional `for` and `while` loops into recursive functions or leverage higher-order functions such as `reduce` and `fold`. We will also discuss how to eliminate index variables by using sequence abstractions and provide practical examples to illustrate these concepts.

### **From Loops to Recursion**

#### **Understanding the Transition**

In imperative languages like Java, loops are a common construct for iterating over data. However, in functional programming, recursion and higher-order functions are preferred due to their alignment with immutability and pure functions. By refactoring loops into recursion, we can achieve cleaner, more expressive, and often more efficient code.

#### **Java Loops vs. Clojure Recursion**

Let's start by examining a simple loop in Java and then refactor it into a recursive function in Clojure.

**Java Example: Calculating the Sum of an Array**

```java
public int sumArray(int[] numbers) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Clojure Equivalent: Using Recursion**

```clojure
(defn sum-array [numbers]
  (loop [nums numbers
         sum 0]
    (if (empty? nums)
      sum
      (recur (rest nums) (+ sum (first nums)))))
```

In the Clojure example, we use the `loop` and `recur` constructs to perform the same operation. The `loop` establishes a recursion point, and `recur` is used to call the recursion with new arguments, ensuring tail-call optimization.

### **Using `reduce` and `fold`**

#### **Simplifying Aggregations**

In many cases, recursion can be further simplified using higher-order functions like `reduce`. These functions abstract the pattern of iterating over a collection and accumulating a result.

**Clojure Example: Using `reduce`**

```clojure
(defn sum-array [numbers]
  (reduce + 0 numbers))
```

Here, `reduce` takes a function (`+`), an initial value (`0`), and a collection (`numbers`). It applies the function to the initial value and the first element, then to the result and the next element, and so on.

#### **Eliminating Index Variables**

One of the advantages of using higher-order functions is the elimination of index variables, which can lead to cleaner and less error-prone code.

**Java Example: Finding Maximum Value with Index**

```java
public int findMax(int[] numbers) {
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] > max) {
            max = numbers[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

**Clojure Equivalent: Using `reduce`**

```clojure
(defn find-max [numbers]
  (reduce max Integer/MIN_VALUE numbers))
```

In this Clojure example, `reduce` is used to find the maximum value without explicitly managing an index variable.

### **Practical Examples of Loop Refactoring**

#### **Example 1: Mapping and Filtering**

Consider a Java loop that filters and transforms a list of integers.

**Java Example: Filtering and Mapping**

```java
public List<Integer> processNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int number : numbers) {
        if (number > 10) {
            result.add(number * 2);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Clojure Equivalent: Using `filter` and `map`**

```clojure
(defn process-numbers [numbers]
  (->> numbers
       (filter #(> % 10))
       (map #(* % 2))))
```

In this example, we use `filter` to select numbers greater than 10 and `map` to double them. The threading macro `->>` is used to chain these operations, creating a pipeline that is both concise and expressive.

#### **Example 2: Recursive Fibonacci**

Let's refactor a loop-based Fibonacci sequence generator into a recursive function.

**Java Example: Fibonacci with Loop**

```java
public int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    int a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return b;
}
```

**Clojure Equivalent: Recursive Fibonacci**

```clojure
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    n
    (+ (fibonacci (- n 1)) (fibonacci (- n 2)))))
```

In this recursive version, the function calls itself to compute the Fibonacci sequence. However, this naive recursion is not efficient for large `n` due to repeated calculations.

**Optimized Clojure: Tail Recursion with `recur`**

```clojure
(defn fibonacci [n]
  (loop [a 0 b 1 i n]
    (if (zero? i)
      a
      (recur b (+ a b) (dec i)))))
```

Using `loop` and `recur`, we achieve tail-call optimization, making the function efficient for larger values of `n`.

### **Knowledge Check**

#### **Exercise: Refactor a Java Loop**

Refactor the following Java loop into a Clojure recursive function:

**Java Code:**

```java
public int countEvenNumbers(int[] numbers) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int number : numbers) {
        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Clojure Hint:**

Consider using a recursive function with `loop` and `recur` or a higher-order function like `filter` and `count`.
