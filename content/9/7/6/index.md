## 7.6 Mutual Recursion and Trampolining

In the realm of functional programming, recursion is a fundamental concept that allows functions to call themselves in order to solve problems. However, when two or more functions call each other recursively, we enter the domain of **mutual recursion**. This technique, while powerful, introduces challenges, particularly in languages running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) due to stack growth issues. In this section, we'll explore mutual recursion, the challenges it presents, and how Clojure's `trampoline` function provides an elegant solution to optimize recursive calls without consuming excessive stack space.

### Understanding Mutual Recursion

**Mutual recursion** occurs when two or more functions are defined in terms of each other. This pattern is useful in scenarios where a problem naturally decomposes into multiple interdependent subproblems. For example, consider a simple problem of determining whether a number is even or odd. We can define two mutually recursive functions, `isEven` and `isOdd`, where `isEven` calls `isOdd` and vice versa.

#### Example: Even and Odd

Let's define these functions in Clojure:

```clojure
(defn is-even? [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    true
    (is-odd? (dec n))))

(defn is-odd? [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    false
    (is-even? (dec n))))
```

In this example, `is-even?` calls `is-odd?` and vice versa, creating a mutually recursive relationship. While this example is simple, it illustrates the concept of mutual recursion effectively.

### Challenges of Mutual Recursion on the JVM

The JVM, which Clojure runs on, uses a call stack to keep track of function calls. Each recursive call adds a new frame to the stack, and if the recursion is too deep, it can lead to a `StackOverflowError`. This is particularly problematic with mutual recursion, as the stack grows with each call between functions.

#### Stack Growth Problem

Consider a scenario where we use mutual recursion to solve a problem with a large input size. The stack frames accumulate quickly, leading to potential stack overflow. This is a significant limitation when implementing algorithms that rely heavily on recursion.

### Introducing Trampolining

Clojure offers a powerful solution to the stack growth problem with mutual recursion through the use of **trampolining**. The `trampoline` function in Clojure allows us to convert recursive calls into a loop, effectively managing stack usage by reusing the same stack frame.

#### How Trampolining Works

The `trampoline` function repeatedly calls a function until it returns a non-function value. If the function returns another function, `trampoline` calls it again, effectively simulating tail recursion and preventing stack growth.

Let's revisit our even and odd example using `trampoline`:

```clojure
(defn is-even? [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    true
    #(is-odd? (dec n))))

(defn is-odd? [n]
  (if (zero? n)
    false
    #(is-even? (dec n))))

(trampoline is-even? 1000000)
```

In this revised version, the functions return a new function (using the `#()` syntax) instead of calling each other directly. The `trampoline` function then takes care of calling these functions repeatedly until a non-function value is returned.

### Implementation Examples

Let's explore a more complex example to see how trampolining can be applied to optimize mutual recursion.

#### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a problem that can be solved recursively. However, calculating Fibonacci numbers using naive recursion can quickly lead to stack overflow. Let's define a mutually recursive solution and optimize it with trampolining.

```clojure
(defn fib-a [n a b]
  (if (zero? n)
    a
    #(fib-b (dec n) b (+ a b))))

(defn fib-b [n a b]
  (if (zero? n)
    a
    #(fib-a (dec n) b (+ a b))))

(trampoline fib-a 100000 0 1)
```

In this example, `fib-a` and `fib-b` are mutually recursive functions that calculate Fibonacci numbers. By using `trampoline`, we can calculate Fibonacci numbers for large `n` without stack overflow.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of mutual recursion and trampolining, try modifying the Fibonacci example to include additional parameters or conditions. Experiment with different recursive problems and see how trampolining can be applied to optimize them.

### Visualizing Mutual Recursion and Trampolining

To better understand how mutual recursion and trampolining work together, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{is-even?}
    B -->|zero?| C[Return true]
    B -->|not zero| D{is-odd?}
    D -->|zero?| E[Return false]
    D -->|not zero| B
```

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process in our even and odd example, showing how the `trampoline` function manages the recursive calls.

### Conclusion

Mutual recursion is a powerful technique in functional programming, but it poses challenges on the JVM due to stack growth. Clojure's `trampoline` function provides an elegant solution by converting recursive calls into a loop, allowing us to manage stack usage effectively. By understanding and applying trampolining, we can build efficient and scalable applications that leverage the full power of recursion.
