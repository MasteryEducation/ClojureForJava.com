## 20.7 Writing Secure Functional Code

In the realm of software development, security is paramount. As we delve into functional programming with Clojure, understanding how to write secure code is crucial. This section will explore how Clojure's functional paradigm can be leveraged to enhance security, focusing on immutability, secure defaults, input validation, and regular security audits.

### **Immutable Data for Security**

Immutability is a cornerstone of functional programming, and it plays a significant role in enhancing security. In Clojure, data structures are immutable by default, meaning once created, they cannot be altered. This immutability provides several security benefits:

1. **Prevention of Unauthorized Modifications**: Immutability ensures that data cannot be changed once it is created, reducing the risk of unauthorized modifications. This is particularly important in multi-threaded environments, where mutable data can lead to race conditions and inconsistent states.

2. **Predictable Code Behavior**: With immutable data, functions will always produce the same output given the same input, which makes the code more predictable and easier to reason about. This predictability reduces the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities through unexpected behavior.

3. **Simplified State Management**: Immutability simplifies state management by eliminating the need for locks and other synchronization mechanisms, which can be sources of security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.

#### **Code Example: Immutability in Clojure**

```clojure
(defn process-data [data]
  ;; Create a new map with transformed data
  (let [transformed-data (assoc data :processed true)]
    ;; Return the transformed data without modifying the original
    transformed-data))

(def original-data {:id 1 :value 100})
(def new-data (process-data original-data))

;; original-data remains unchanged
(println original-data)  ;; Output: {:id 1, :value 100}
(println new-data)       ;; Output: {:id 1, :value 100, :processed true}
```

In this example, `original-data` remains unchanged after processing, demonstrating how immutability prevents accidental or malicious data modifications.

### **Secure Defaults**

Adopting secure defaults is a best practice in application development. Secure defaults mean configuring systems in a way that minimizes vulnerabilities from the outset. In Clojure, this can involve:

1. **Defaulting to Least Privilege**: Ensure that functions and components operate with the least amount of privilege necessary. This limits the potential damage if a component is compromised.

2. **Secure Configuration Settings**: Use secure default settings for configuration files and environment variables. For example, ensure that sensitive information like API keys and passwords are not hard-coded and are stored securely.

3. **Safe Defaults for Data Handling**: When handling data, default to safe operations. For instance, use secure hashing algorithms for storing passwords rather than reversible encryption.

#### **Code Example: Secure Defaults**

```clojure
(defn hash-password [password]
  ;; Use a secure hashing algorithm with a salt
  (let [salt (generate-salt)]
    (hash-with-salt password salt)))

(defn authenticate-user [input-password stored-hash]
  ;; Compare hashed input password with stored hash
  (if (= (hash-password input-password) stored-hash)
    :authenticated
    :unauthorized))
```

This example demonstrates secure password handling by using a hashing algorithm, ensuring passwords are not stored in plain text.

### **Input Validation**

Validating external inputs is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. Clojure provides several tools and libraries to facilitate input validation:

1. **Use `clojure.spec` for Data Validation**: `clojure.spec` is a powerful library for specifying the structure of data and validating it. It can be used to enforce constraints on input data, ensuring it meets the expected format and type.

2. **Sanitize Inputs**: Always sanitize inputs to remove potentially harmful content. This is especially important for inputs that will be executed or rendered, such as SQL queries or HTML content.

3. **Validate External Data Sources**: When integrating with external data sources, validate the data to ensure it conforms to expected schemas and does not contain malicious content.

#### **Code Example: Input Validation with `clojure.spec`**

```clojure
(require '[clojure.spec.alpha :as s])

;; Define a spec for user input
(s/def ::username (s/and string? #(re-matches #"\w+" %)))
(s/def ::password (s/and string? #(> (count %) 8)))

(defn validate-user-input [username password]
  (if (and (s/valid? ::username username)
           (s/valid? ::password password))
    :valid
    :invalid))

;; Example usage
(validate-user-input "user123" "securePassword")  ;; Output: :valid
(validate-user-input "user123" "short")           ;; Output: :invalid
```

This example uses `clojure.spec` to validate user inputs, ensuring they meet defined criteria before processing.

### **Regular Security Audits**

Regular security audits are essential to maintaining a secure codebase. These audits involve:

1. **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Pair programming and peer reviews can be effective in catching potential issues early.

2. **Security Testing**: Implement automated security tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline. Tools like OWASP ZAP can be integrated to scan for vulnerabilities.

3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools to monitor for outdated or vulnerable libraries.

4. **Security Training**: Provide ongoing security training for developers to keep them informed about the latest security threats and best practices.

#### **Code Example: Dependency Management with Leiningen**

```clojure
;; project.clj
(defproject secure-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]]
  :plugins [[lein-ancient "0.6.15"]])

;; Run lein ancient to check for outdated dependencies
;; $ lein ancient
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `lein-ancient` plugin to manage dependencies and ensure they are up to date.
