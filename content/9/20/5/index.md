#### How to Get Started

- **Find a Project**: Look for projects that interest you on platforms like GitHub. The [Clojure GitHub Organization](https://github.com/clojure) is a good place to start.
- **Join the Community**: Engage with the project's community by joining mailing lists or chat rooms. This will help you understand the project's goals and how you can contribute.
- **Start Small**: Begin with small contributions, such as fixing bugs or improving documentation. This will help you get familiar with the project's codebase and build confidence.

### Try It Yourself: Contributing to an Open Source Project

To get started with open-source contributions, try the following exercise:

1. **Choose a Clojure Project**: Visit the [Clojure GitHub Organization](https://github.com/clojure) and select a project that interests you.
2. **Read the Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the project's documentation and contribution guidelines.
3. **Identify an Issue**: Look for open issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" and choose one to work on.
4. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository and clone it to your local machine.
5. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes and test them locally.
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request to the original repository.
