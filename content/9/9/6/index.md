## 9.6 Advanced Collections: Queues, Stacks, and Heaps

In this section, we delve into advanced collections in Clojure—queues, stacks, and heaps. These data structures are crucial for building efficient, scalable applications, particularly in scenarios involving task scheduling, resource management, and data processing. We'll explore how these collections are implemented in a functional programming context, leveraging Clojure's immutable and persistent data structures.

### Functional Queues

Queues are a fundamental data structure used to manage ordered collections of elements. In a functional programming context, implementing queues involves ensuring that operations like enqueue and dequeue are efficient and maintain immutability.

#### Implementing Queues in Clojure

In Clojure, queues can be implemented using the `clojure.lang.PersistentQueue` class. This implementation provides a functional approach to queues, supporting efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.

```clojure
; Create an empty queue
(def my-queue (clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY))

; Enqueue elements
(def my-queue (conj my-queue 1))
(def my-queue (conj my-queue 2))
(def my-queue (conj my-queue 3))

; Dequeue an element
(def dequeued (peek my-queue)) ; returns 1
(def my-queue (pop my-queue))  ; removes the first element

; Check the current state of the queue
(println my-queue) ; prints (2 3)
```

In this example, we use `conj` to add elements to the queue and `pop` to remove the front element. The `peek` function retrieves the front element without removing it. This approach ensures that each operation returns a new queue, preserving immutability.

#### Use Cases for Queues

Queues are ideal for scenarios such as:

- **Task Scheduling**: Managing tasks in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.
- **Resource Management**: Handling requests to a shared resource.
- **Breadth-First Search**: Implementing algorithms that explore nodes layer by layer.

### Stacks

Stacks are another essential data structure, characterized by their last-in, first-out (LIFO) behavior. In Clojure, stacks can be implemented using lists, which naturally support stack operations.

#### Implementing Stacks with Persistent Data Structures

Clojure's lists are inherently persistent, making them suitable for stack operations. Here's how you can implement a stack using lists:

```clojure
; Create an empty stack
(def my-stack '())

; Push elements onto the stack
(def my-stack (conj my-stack 1))
(def my-stack (conj my-stack 2))
(def my-stack (conj my-stack 3))

; Pop an element from the stack
(def popped (peek my-stack)) ; returns 3
(def my-stack (pop my-stack)) ; removes the top element

; Check the current state of the stack
(println my-stack) ; prints (2 1)
```

In this implementation, `conj` adds elements to the front of the list, and `pop` removes the top element, maintaining the LIFO order.

#### Use Cases for Stacks

Stacks are useful in:

- **Expression Evaluation**: Parsing and evaluating expressions in compilers.
- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Exploring possible solutions in depth-first search.
- **Undo Mechanisms**: Implementing undo functionality in applications.

### Heaps and Priority Queues

Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that facilitate efficient priority queue operations. They are particularly useful for scenarios where elements need to be processed based on priority rather than order of insertion.

#### Creating and Using Heaps in Clojure

While Clojure does not have a built-in heap implementation, we can use libraries such as `clojure.data.priority-map` to create priority queues.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.data.priority-map :refer [priority-map]])

; Create a priority queue
(def my-heap (priority-map))

; Insert elements with priorities
(def my-heap (assoc my-heap :task1 1))
(def my-heap (assoc my-heap :task2 3))
(def my-heap (assoc my-heap :task3 2))

; Access the element with the highest priority
(def top-task (peek my-heap)) ; returns [:task1 1]

; Remove the element with the highest priority
(def my-heap (pop my-heap))

; Check the current state of the heap
(println my-heap) ; prints {:task3 2, :task2 3}
```

In this example, `priority-map` allows us to associate elements with priorities, supporting efficient retrieval and removal of the highest-priority element.

#### Use Cases for Heaps

Heaps are applicable in:

- **Task Scheduling**: Prioritizing tasks based on urgency.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path.
- **Event Simulation**: Managing events in a priority-driven simulation.

### Visualizing Data Structures

To better understand how these data structures operate, let's visualize their operations using diagrams.

#### Queue Operations

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Initial Queue: ( )] --> B[Enqueue 1: (1)];
    B --> C[Enqueue 2: (1, 2)];
    C --> D[Enqueue 3: (1, 2, 3)];
    D --> E[Dequeue: (2, 3)];
```

*Figure 1: Queue Operations - Enqueue and Dequeue*

#### Stack Operations

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Initial Stack: ( )] --> B[Push 1: (1)];
    B --> C[Push 2: (2, 1)];
    C --> D[Push 3: (3, 2, 1)];
    D --> E[Pop: (2, 1)];
```

*Figure 2: Stack Operations - Push and Pop*

#### Heap Operations

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Initial Heap: { }] --> B[Insert :task1 1: {:task1 1}];
    B --> C[Insert :task2 3: {:task1 1, :task2 3}];
    C --> D[Insert :task3 2: {:task1 1, :task3 2, :task2 3}];
    D --> E[Remove Highest Priority: {:task3 2, :task2 3}];
```

### Comparing Java OOP and Clojure Implementations

For developers transitioning from Java OOP, understanding how these data structures map to Clojure's functional paradigm is crucial. In Java, queues, stacks, and heaps are typically implemented using classes and interfaces such as `Queue`, `Stack`, and `PriorityQueue`. These structures rely on mutable states and imperative operations.

In contrast, Clojure emphasizes immutability and persistent data structures. Operations on these structures return new versions without modifying the original, ensuring thread safety and consistency.

### Practical Applications and Scenarios

Let's explore some practical scenarios where these advanced collections are beneficial:

1. **Concurrent Task Management**: Use queues to manage tasks across multiple threads, ensuring tasks are processed in order.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement graph traversal algorithms using stacks for depth-first search and heaps for shortest path calculations.
3. **Simulation Systems**: Use heaps to manage events in simulation systems, prioritizing events based on their scheduled time.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding, try modifying the code examples:

- **Queues**: Implement a circular queue that wraps around when it reaches the end.
- **Stacks**: Create a stack that supports additional operations like `peek-n` to view the top `n` elements.
- **Heaps**: Extend the priority queue to support custom comparator functions for different priority criteria.
