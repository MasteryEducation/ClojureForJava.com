## 9.5 Designing Custom Functional Data Structures

Designing custom functional data structures in Clojure requires a deep understanding of the functional programming paradigm, which emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative code. In this section, we will explore how to create new data structures that adhere to these principles, using Clojure's powerful features such as protocols and polymorphism. We will also discuss the performance trade-offs involved in designing these data structures, ensuring that they are efficient and scalable.

### Creating New Data Structures

In functional programming, data structures are typically immutable, meaning that once created, their state cannot be changed. This immutability offers several benefits, including easier reasoning about code, thread safety, and the ability to share data without copying. However, it also presents challenges when designing custom data structures, as we must ensure that operations on these structures are efficient.

#### Understanding Immutability

Before diving into the design process, let's revisit the concept of immutability. In Clojure, data structures such as lists, vectors, maps, and sets are immutable by default. This means that any operation that modifies a data structure actually returns a new version of that structure, leaving the original unchanged.

Consider the following example:

```clojure
(def original-vector [1 2 3])
(def new-vector (conj original-vector 4))

(println original-vector) ; Output: [1 2 3]
(println new-vector)      ; Output: [1 2 3 4]
```

Here, `conj` adds an element to the vector, but instead of modifying `original-vector`, it returns a new vector `new-vector`.

#### Designing Custom Data Structures

When designing a custom data structure, we must consider how it will be used and what operations it needs to support. This involves defining the data representation and the functions that operate on it.

Let's design a simple custom data structure: a functional stack. A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure with two main operations: `push` (to add an element) and `pop` (to remove the most recently added element).

```clojure
(defn create-stack []
  '())

(defn push [stack element]
  (cons element stack))

(defn pop [stack]
  (if (empty? stack)
    (throw (Exception. "Stack is empty"))
    [(first stack) (rest stack)]))

(def stack (create-stack))
(def stack1 (push stack 1))
(def stack2 (push stack1 2))
(def [top stack3] (pop stack2))

(println stack2) ; Output: (2 1)
(println top)    ; Output: 2
(println stack3) ; Output: (1)
```

In this example, `create-stack` initializes an empty stack, `push` adds an element to the stack, and `pop` removes the top element. Note that each operation returns a new stack, preserving immutability.

### Protocols and Polymorphism

Clojure's protocols provide a way to define a set of functions that can be implemented by different types, similar to interfaces in Java. This allows us to define common operations for our custom data structures and enable polymorphic behavior.

#### Defining Protocols

Let's define a protocol for our stack data structure:

```clojure
(defprotocol StackProtocol
  (push [stack element] "Push an element onto the stack")
  (pop [stack] "Pop the top element from the stack"))

(defrecord FunctionalStack [elements]
  StackProtocol
  (push [stack element]
    (FunctionalStack. (cons element elements)))
  (pop [stack]
    (if (empty? elements)
      (throw (Exception. "Stack is empty"))
      [(first elements) (FunctionalStack. (rest elements))])))

(def my-stack (->FunctionalStack '()))
(def my-stack1 (push my-stack 1))
(def my-stack2 (push my-stack1 2))
(def [top my-stack3] (pop my-stack2))

(println (:elements my-stack2)) ; Output: (2 1)
(println top)                   ; Output: 2
(println (:elements my-stack3)) ; Output: (1)
```

In this example, we define a `StackProtocol` with `push` and `pop` methods. We then create a `FunctionalStack` record that implements this protocol. This approach allows us to easily extend the stack's functionality or create new data structures that adhere to the same interface.

#### Polymorphism in Clojure

Polymorphism allows us to write code that can operate on different types of data structures without knowing their specific implementations. In Clojure, this is achieved through protocols and multimethods.

Consider a scenario where we have multiple stack implementations, such as a linked list-based stack and an array-based stack. By defining a common protocol, we can write functions that work with any stack implementation:

```clojure
(defrecord ArrayStack [elements]
  StackProtocol
  (push [stack element]
    (ArrayStack. (conj elements element)))
  (pop [stack]
    (if (empty? elements)
      (throw (Exception. "Stack is empty"))
      [(peek elements) (ArrayStack. (pop elements))])))

(defn stack-size [stack]
  (count (:elements stack)))

(def array-stack (->ArrayStack []))
(def array-stack1 (push array-stack 1))
(def array-stack2 (push array-stack1 2))
(def [top array-stack3] (pop array-stack2))

(println (stack-size array-stack2)) ; Output: 2
(println top)                       ; Output: 2
(println (stack-size array-stack3)) ; Output: 1
```

Here, we define an `ArrayStack` that implements the same `StackProtocol`. The `stack-size` function operates on any stack implementation, demonstrating polymorphism.

### Performance Trade-offs

When designing custom data structures, it's crucial to consider the performance implications of immutability and the chosen data representation. Let's explore some key considerations.

#### Structural Sharing

Clojure's persistent data structures leverage structural sharing to minimize memory usage and improve performance. When a data structure is modified, only the parts that change are copied, while the rest is shared with the original structure.

For example, when adding an element to a vector, Clojure creates a new vector that shares most of its structure with the original:

```clojure
(def original-vector [1 2 3])
(def new-vector (conj original-vector 4))

; Both vectors share the structure for the first three elements.
```

Structural sharing is a powerful technique that allows immutable data structures to be efficient in both time and space.

#### Time Complexity

The choice of data representation affects the time complexity of operations. For instance, adding an element to a list is O(1) because it involves prepending to the list, while accessing an element by index is O(n) because it requires traversing the list.

When designing custom data structures, we must carefully consider the time complexity of common operations and choose representations that optimize for these operations.

#### Memory Usage

Immutability can lead to increased memory usage, as each modification creates a new version of the data structure. However, structural sharing mitigates this by reusing existing structure.

It's essential to balance memory usage with performance, especially in memory-constrained environments. Profiling and benchmarking can help identify bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored the design of custom functional data structures, let's encourage you to experiment with your own implementations. Consider modifying the stack example to include additional operations, such as `peek` or `is-empty`. You could also try implementing other data structures, such as queues or trees, using Clojure's protocols and immutability principles.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the relationship between Java OOP concepts and Clojure's functional paradigm, let's visualize how Java classes map to Clojure namespaces and functions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    JavaClass <|-- ClojureNamespace
    JavaClass : +method()
    ClojureNamespace : +function()

    class JavaClass {
        +field: Type
        +method(): ReturnType
    }

    class ClojureNamespace {
        +function(): ReturnType
    }
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram illustrates the mapping between a Java class and a Clojure namespace. In Java, a class encapsulates fields and methods, while in Clojure, a namespace groups related functions. This highlights the shift from object-oriented design to functional design.
