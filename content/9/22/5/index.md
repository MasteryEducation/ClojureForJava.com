## 22.5 Building RESTful APIs with `Liberator`

In this section, we will explore how to build RESTful APIs using the `Liberator` library in Clojure. We'll review the fundamental principles of REST, introduce the `Liberator` library, and demonstrate how to create declarative resources, handle content negotiation, manage errors, and implement a sample API endpoint.

### REST Fundamentals

Before diving into `Liberator`, it's essential to understand the core principles that define RESTful services. REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that uses a stateless, client-server communication model. Here are some key constraints of REST:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server are separate entities, allowing them to evolve independently.
- **Statelessness**: Each request from a client must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
- **Cacheability**: Responses must be defined as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve performance.
- **Layered System**: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, each with specific responsibilities.
- **Uniform Interface**: This constraint defines a standardized way for the client and server to communicate, including resource identification, manipulation through representations, self-descriptive messages, and hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS).

### `Liberator` Overview

[Liberator](https://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/) is a Clojure library designed to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs by focusing on resource semantics rather than request handling. It allows developers to define resources declaratively, using a decision graph to manage the lifecycle of HTTP requests and responses.

Liberator is built on top of [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring), a Clojure web application library, and provides a higher-level abstraction for building RESTful services. By leveraging Liberator, developers can focus on the business logic of their resources, while the library handles the complexities of HTTP compliance.

### Declarative Resources

One of the key features of Liberator is its use of a decision graph to process requests. This graph represents the various states and transitions that a resource can go through, based on the HTTP method and request parameters. By defining resources declaratively, developers can specify the behavior of their APIs in a clear and concise manner.

#### Example: Defining a Resource

Let's define a simple resource using Liberator. We'll create a resource that handles GET requests to retrieve information about a specific item.

```clojure
(ns my-api.core
  (:require [liberator.core :refer [resource defresource]]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]))

(defresource item-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json"]
  :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
               {:id 1
                :name "Sample Item"
                :description "This is a sample item."}))

(defn start-server []
  (run-jetty (resource item-resource) {:port 8080}))
```

In this example, we define a resource called `item-resource` that responds to GET requests with a JSON representation of an item. The `:handle-ok` function specifies the response content when the request is successful.

### Content Negotiation

Content negotiation is a crucial aspect of RESTful services, allowing clients to specify the desired format of the response. Liberator provides built-in support for content negotiation, enabling developers to handle different media types seamlessly.

#### Example: Handling Multiple Media Types

Let's extend our previous example to support both JSON and XML responses.

```clojure
(defresource item-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json" "application/xml"]
  :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
               (let [item {:id 1
                           :name "Sample Item"
                           :description "This is a sample item."}]
                 (case (get-in ctx [:representation :media-type])
                   "application/json" item
                   "application/xml" (str "<item><id>1</id><name>Sample Item</name><description>This is a sample item.</description></item>")))))
```

In this example, we use the `:available-media-types` key to specify the supported formats. The `:handle-ok` function checks the requested media type and returns the appropriate representation.

### Error Handling and Responses

Liberator simplifies error handling by providing a structured way to define responses for various error conditions. Developers can specify custom responses for different HTTP status codes, ensuring that clients receive meaningful feedback.

#### Example: Handling Not Found Errors

Let's modify our resource to handle cases where the requested item is not found.

```clojure
(defresource item-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json"]
  :exists? (fn [ctx]
             (let [item (get-item-by-id (get-in ctx [:request :params :id]))]
               [item {:item item}]))
  :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
               (:item ctx))
  :handle-not-found (fn [ctx]
                      {:error "Item not found"}))
```

In this example, we use the `:exists?` key to check if the item exists. If the item is found, it is added to the context. Otherwise, the `:handle-not-found` function returns an error message.

### API Implementation Example

Let's build a complete RESTful API endpoint using Liberator, demonstrating key features such as declarative resources, content negotiation, and error handling.

#### Example: A Simple API for Managing Items

We'll create a simple API that allows clients to create, retrieve, update, and delete items.

```clojure
(def items (atom {}))

(defresource item-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json"]
  :allowed-methods [:get :post :put :delete]
  :exists? (fn [ctx]
             (let [id (get-in ctx [:request :params :id])
                   item (get @items id)]
               [item {:item item}]))
  :handle-ok (fn [ctx]
               (:item ctx))
  :post! (fn [ctx]
           (let [id (str (count @items))
                 item (assoc (get-in ctx [:request :json-params]) :id id)]
             (swap! items assoc id item)
             {:status 201 :item item}))
  :put! (fn [ctx]
          (let [id (get-in ctx [:request :params :id])
                item (assoc (get-in ctx [:request :json-params]) :id id)]
            (swap! items assoc id item)
            {:status 200 :item item}))
  :delete! (fn [ctx]
             (let [id (get-in ctx [:request :params :id])]
               (swap! items dissoc id)
               {:status 204}))
  :handle-not-found (fn [ctx]
                      {:error "Item not found"}))

(defn start-server []
  (run-jetty (resource item-resource) {:port 8080}))
```

In this example, we define a resource that supports CRUD operations. We use an atom to store items in memory and define handlers for each HTTP method. The `:post!`, `:put!`, and `:delete!` keys specify the actions to take for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively.

### Visualizing the Decision Graph

To better understand how Liberator processes requests, let's visualize the decision graph used to manage resource states.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is Resource Available?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Is Method Allowed?}
    B -->|No| D[Respond 404 Not Found]
    C -->|Yes| E{Is Content Negotiation Successful?}
    C -->|No| F[Respond 405 Method Not Allowed]
    E -->|Yes| G[Process Request]
    E -->|No| H[Respond 406 Not Acceptable]
    G --> I[Generate Response]
    I --> J[End]
```
