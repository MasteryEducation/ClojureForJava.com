## 22.3 Web Development with `Ring` and `Compojure`

In the realm of Clojure web development, `Ring` and `Compojure` stand out as pivotal tools that allow developers to build robust, scalable web applications. This section will guide you through understanding these tools, their concepts, and how to effectively use them to create web applications. We'll also touch on templating engines like `Selmer` to generate dynamic HTML content. Let's dive in and explore the world of Clojure web development.

### Understanding `Ring`

`Ring` is the cornerstone of web application development in Clojure. It provides a simple yet powerful abstraction for handling HTTP requests and responses. At its core, `Ring` is influenced by the Rack interface from Ruby, which focuses on a simple, unified way of handling web requests.

#### The `Ring` Abstraction

In `Ring`, a web application is essentially a function that takes a request map and returns a response map. This simplicity allows for great flexibility and composability.

Here's a basic example of a `Ring` handler:

```clojure
(defn handler [request]
  {:status 200
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "Hello, World!"})
```

- **Request Map**: Contains information about the HTTP request, such as `:uri`, `:method`, and `:headers`.
- **Response Map**: Defines the HTTP response, including `:status`, `:headers`, and `:body`.

#### Middleware Concept

Middleware in `Ring` is a function that takes a handler and returns a new handler. Middleware can be used to add common functionality like logging, session management, or authentication.

Here's an example of a simple logging middleware:

```clojure
(defn wrap-logger [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (println "Request received:" request)
    (handler request)))
```

This middleware logs each request before passing it to the original handler. Middleware functions can be composed to build a stack of processing layers around your handler.

**Visualizing Middleware Flow**

```mermaid

    Request -->|Middleware 1| M1[Middleware 1]
    M1 -->|Middleware 2| M2[Middleware 2]
    M2 -->|Handler| H[Handler]
    H -->|Response| M2
    M2 -->|Response| M1
    M1 -->|Response| Request
```

### Routing with `Compojure`

While `Ring` provides the foundation, `Compojure` adds a layer of elegance with its routing capabilities. `Compojure` allows you to define routes and handle HTTP requests in a declarative and concise manner.

#### Defining Routes

In `Compojure`, routes are defined using macros that match HTTP methods and URIs to handler functions.

Here's a simple example:

```clojure
(require '[compojure.core :refer :all])

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Welcome to my website!")
  (GET "/about" [] "About Us")
  (POST "/submit" req (str "Submitted: " (:body req))))
```

- **GET, POST, etc.**: Macros that define routes for different HTTP methods.
- **Handler Functions**: Functions that process the request and generate a response.

#### Composing Routes

Routes can be composed using the `routes` macro, allowing you to build complex routing structures.

```clojure
(defroutes main-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Home Page")
  (context "/api" []
    (GET "/users" [] "User List")
    (POST "/users" [] "Create User")))
```

### Templates and Templating

For generating dynamic HTML content, integrating a templating engine is essential. `Selmer` is a popular choice in the Clojure ecosystem for this purpose.

#### Integrating `Selmer`

`Selmer` is a templating engine inspired by Django's templating system. It allows you to separate HTML structure from your Clojure code.

Here's how you can use `Selmer`:

1. **Add Dependency**: First, add `Selmer` to your `project.clj`.

```clojure
:dependencies [[selmer "1.12.31"]]
```

2. **Create a Template**: Create an HTML file with placeholders.

```html
<!-- resources/templates/welcome.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome, {{name}}!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

3. **Render the Template**: Use `Selmer` to render the template with data.

```clojure
(require '[selmer.parser :as parser])

(defn welcome-page [name]
  (parser/render-file "templates/welcome.html" {:name name}))
```

### Sample Web Application

Let's build a simple web application using `Ring`, `Compojure`, and `Selmer`.

#### Project Setup

Start by creating a new Clojure project:

```bash
lein new app my-web-app
```

Add the necessary dependencies to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
               [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]
               [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.9.0"]
               [compojure "1.6.2"]
               [selmer "1.12.31"]]
```

#### Creating the Handler

Create a handler that uses `Compojure` for routing and `Selmer` for templating:

```clojure
(ns my-web-app.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]
            [ring.adapter.jetty :refer [run-jetty]]
            [selmer.parser :as parser]))

(defn home-page [request]
  (parser/render-file "templates/home.html" {:title "Home"}))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] home-page)
  (route/not-found "Page not found"))

(def app
  (wrap-logger app-routes))
```

#### Running the Application

Start the Jetty server to run your application:

```clojure
(defn -main []
  (run-jetty app {:port 3000 :join? false}))
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your web application in action.

### Try It Yourself

To enhance your understanding, try the following modifications:

- Add a new route that displays a list of items.
- Implement a form submission using a POST route.
- Integrate session management using Ring middleware.
