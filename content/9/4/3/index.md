## 4.3 Avoiding Side Effects in Functions

In the realm of functional programming, one of the key principles is to write functions that are pure, meaning they do not have side effects. This section will explore what side effects are, why they matter, and how to avoid them in Clojure, enabling you to build more predictable and maintainable applications.

### Understanding Side Effects

**Side effects** occur when a function interacts with the outside world or modifies some state outside its local environment. In contrast, a **pure function** is one that, given the same input, will always return the same output without modifying any external state.

#### Impact of Side Effects on Function Purity

Side effects can lead to unpredictable behavior, making it difficult to understand, test, and maintain code. They introduce dependencies on the external state, which can change unexpectedly, leading to bugs that are hard to trace. In contrast, pure functions are deterministic and easier to reason about, test, and refactor.

#### Common Side Effects

1. **Modifying Global Variables**: Changing the state of a variable that exists outside the function scope.
2. **I/O Operations**: Reading from or writing to files, databases, or network resources.
3. **Mutating Arguments**: Altering the data passed into the function.
4. **Logging**: Writing logs to a file or console.
5. **Random Number Generation**: Producing different outputs for the same input due to randomness.

### Strategies to Avoid Side Effects

To embrace functional programming fully, it is crucial to avoid side effects. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

#### Passing in Necessary Data

Instead of relying on external state, pass all necessary data into the function as arguments. This ensures that the function does not depend on any external variables, making it self-contained and predictable.

```clojure
(defn calculate-area [length width]
  (* length width))
```

In this example, `calculate-area` is a pure function because it relies only on its input parameters.

#### Returning New Values

Instead of modifying existing data structures, return new ones. Clojure's immutable data structures make this approach efficient and straightforward.

```clojure
(defn add-to-list [lst item]
  (conj lst item))
```

Here, `add-to-list` returns a new list with the added item, leaving the original list unchanged.

#### Using Local Variables

Use local bindings within functions to avoid modifying external variables. Clojure's `let` form allows you to define local variables that are only accessible within the function's scope.

```clojure
(defn calculate-total [prices]
  (let [tax-rate 0.05
        total (reduce + prices)]
    (* total (+ 1 tax-rate))))
```

In this function, `tax-rate` and `total` are local variables, ensuring that no external state is altered.

#### Refactoring Impure Functions

Refactoring impure functions involves identifying side effects and restructuring the code to eliminate them. Let's consider a function that modifies a global variable:

```clojure
(def total-sales 0)

(defn add-sale [amount]
  (set! total-sales (+ total-sales amount)))
```

To refactor this function into a pure one, we can pass the current total as an argument and return the new total:

```clojure
(defn add-sale [current-total amount]
  (+ current-total amount))
```

Now, `add-sale` no longer modifies `total-sales` directly, making it pure.

### Practical Examples and Code Refactoring

#### Example 1: Refactoring a Logging Function

Consider a function that logs messages to the console:

```clojure
(defn log-message [message]
  (println "Log: " message))
```

To refactor this function, we can separate the logging side effect from the message formatting:

```clojure
(defn format-log-message [message]
  (str "Log: " message))

(defn log-message [formatted-message]
  (println formatted-message))
```

Now, `format-log-message` is pure, and the side effect is isolated in `log-message`.

#### Example 2: Handling Randomness

A function that generates random numbers is inherently impure:

```clojure
(defn random-number []
  (rand-int 100))
```

To refactor, pass the random number generator as a parameter:

```clojure
(defn random-number [rng]
  (rng 100))

(random-number rand-int)
```

This approach allows for easier testing and control over randomness.

### Knowledge Check

1. **What is a side effect in functional programming?**
   - A side effect occurs when a function interacts with the outside world or modifies some state outside its local environment.

2. **Why is avoiding side effects important?**
   - Avoiding side effects leads to more predictable, testable, and maintainable code.

3. **How can you refactor a function that modifies a global variable?**
   - Pass the variable as an argument and return a new value instead of modifying the global variable.

4. **What is a pure function?**
   - A pure function is one that, given the same input, always returns the same output without modifying any external state.

5. **How can randomness be handled in a pure function?**
   - Pass the random number generator as a parameter to control randomness and make the function testable.

### Exercises

1. **Refactor the following impure function to be pure:**

```clojure
(def counter 0)

(defn increment-counter []
  (set! counter (inc counter)))
```

2. **Create a pure function that reads a list of prices and returns the total with tax, without modifying the original list.**

3. **Write a pure function that takes a list and an item, and returns a new list with the item added, without using `conj`.**

### Encouraging Engagement

Embracing functional programming can be challenging, but with each step, you'll gain a deeper understanding and see tangible benefits in your codebase. Keep experimenting and refactoring your functions to achieve purity and avoid side effects.
