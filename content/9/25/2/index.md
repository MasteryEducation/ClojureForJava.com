### Code Examples and Exercises

To reinforce your learning, let's explore some practical code examples and exercises. These examples will help you apply the concepts you've learned and experiment with Clojure's features.

#### Example 1: Implementing a Simple Function

```clojure
;; Define a function that calculates the factorial of a number
(defn factorial [n]
  (if (<= n 1)
    1
    (* n (factorial (dec n)))))

;; Test the function
(println (factorial 5)) ; Output: 120
```

> **Try It Yourself:** Modify the `factorial` function to use tail recursion for improved performance.

#### Example 2: Using Higher-Order Functions

```clojure
;; Define a function that applies a given function to each element in a list
(defn apply-to-list [f lst]
  (map f lst))

;; Test the function with a lambda that doubles each number
(println (apply-to-list #(* 2 %) [1 2 3 4])) ; Output: (2 4 6 8)
```

> **Try It Yourself:** Experiment with different functions to apply to the list, such as incrementing each number or converting numbers to strings.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the transition from Java OOP to Clojure's functional paradigm, let's explore some visual aids.
