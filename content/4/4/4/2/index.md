## 4.4.2 Building APIs for Single Page Applications

Single Page Applications (SPAs) have become a popular choice for building dynamic, responsive web applications. They rely heavily on APIs to fetch data and perform operations, making the design and implementation of these APIs crucial for the application's success. In this section, we will explore how to build robust APIs for SPAs using Clojure, focusing on RESTful API design principles, JSON handling, API versioning, and securing API endpoints.

### RESTful API Design

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that provides a set of guidelines for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are characterized by stateless communication, a uniform interface, and the use of standard HTTP methods. Here are some key principles to consider when designing RESTful APIs:

#### 1. Use of HTTP Methods

RESTful APIs leverage standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources:

- **GET**: Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
- **POST**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

Each method should be used according to its intended purpose to maintain consistency and predictability.

#### 2. Resource-Based URLs

APIs should be designed around resources, with URLs representing these resources. A well-structured URL should be intuitive and convey the hierarchy of resources:

```
GET /api/users          // Retrieve all users
GET /api/users/{id}     // Retrieve a specific user
POST /api/users         // Create a new user
PUT /api/users/{id}     // Update a specific user
DELETE /api/users/{id}  // Delete a specific user
```

#### 3. Statelessness

Each API request should contain all the information needed to process it. This means that the server does not store any session information, making the API stateless. Statelessness improves scalability and reliability.

#### 4. Use of HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes provide information about the outcome of an API request. Using the correct status codes helps clients understand the response:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: A new resource was created.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was malformed.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource does not exist.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server.

#### 5. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)

HATEOAS is a constraint of REST that allows clients to navigate the API dynamically by including hyperlinks in the responses. This decouples the client from the server and allows for more flexible interactions.

### JSON Handling

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. In Clojure, handling JSON is straightforward with libraries like `cheshire`.

#### Serializing and Deserializing JSON

To work with JSON in Clojure, you can use the `cheshire` library, which provides functions to serialize Clojure data structures to JSON and deserialize JSON to Clojure data structures.

**Adding Cheshire to Your Project**

First, add `cheshire` to your `project.clj` dependencies:

```clojure
(defproject my-api "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [cheshire "5.10.0"]])
```

**Serializing Clojure Data Structures to JSON**

```clojure
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])

(def user {:id 1 :name "John Doe" :email "john.doe@example.com"})

(def user-json (json/generate-string user))
;; => "{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john.doe@example.com\"}"
```

**Deserializing JSON to Clojure Data Structures**

```clojure
(def user-json "{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"email\":\"john.doe@example.com\"}")

(def user (json/parse-string user-json true))
;; => {:id 1, :name "John Doe", :email "john.doe@example.com"}
```

The `true` argument in `parse-string` indicates that keys should be converted to keywords.

### API Versioning

API versioning is essential for maintaining backward compatibility and allowing clients to transition smoothly to new API versions. There are several strategies for versioning APIs:

#### 1. URI Versioning

Include the version number in the URL path:

```
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users
```

This approach is simple and explicit but can lead to duplication of logic across versions.

#### 2. Query Parameter Versioning

Specify the version number as a query parameter:

```
GET /api/users?version=1
GET /api/users?version=2
```

This method keeps the URL structure consistent but can be less visible to clients.

#### 3. Header Versioning

Include the version number in a custom HTTP header:

```
GET /api/users
Headers: 
  Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json
```

Header versioning keeps URLs clean and is flexible but requires clients to manage headers.

#### 4. Content Negotiation

Use the `Accept` header to specify the desired version:

```
GET /api/users
Headers: 
  Accept: application/json; version=1
```

This approach leverages existing HTTP mechanisms but can be complex to implement.

### Authentication and Authorization

Securing API endpoints is critical to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources. There are several methods for implementing authentication and authorization:

#### 1. Basic Authentication

Basic authentication involves sending a username and password with each request. It is simple to implement but not secure unless used over HTTPS.

```clojure
(require '[ring.middleware.basic-authentication :refer [wrap-basic-authentication]])

(defn authenticated? [username password]
  (and (= username "admin") (= password "secret")))

(def app
  (wrap-basic-authentication handler authenticated?))
```

#### 2. Token-Based Authentication

Token-based authentication involves issuing a token to the client after successful login, which is then used to authenticate subsequent requests. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a popular choice for token-based authentication.

**Generating JWTs**

```clojure
(require '[buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt])

(def secret "my-secret-key")

(def token (jwt/sign {:user-id 1} secret))
;; => "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyLWlkIjoxfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
```

**Verifying JWTs**

```clojure
(def claims (jwt/unsign token secret))
;; => {:user-id 1}
```

#### 3. OAuth2

OAuth2 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization, allowing third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials. Implementing OAuth2 involves setting up an authorization server and managing access tokens.

#### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC restricts access to resources based on the user's role. This approach involves defining roles and permissions and checking them against the user's role during authorization.

**Implementing RBAC**

```clojure
(def roles {:admin #{:read :write :delete}
            :user  #{:read}})

(defn authorized? [role permission]
  (contains? (get roles role) permission))

(authorized? :admin :delete) ;; => true
(authorized? :user :delete)  ;; => false
```

### Conclusion

Building APIs for Single Page Applications with Clojure involves adhering to RESTful design principles, handling JSON data efficiently, implementing robust versioning strategies, and securing API endpoints through authentication and authorization. By following these guidelines, you can create APIs that are scalable, maintainable, and secure, providing a solid foundation for your SPAs.
