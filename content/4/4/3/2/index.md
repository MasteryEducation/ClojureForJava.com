## 4.3.2 Using ORM Libraries like Yesql for Efficient Database Interaction in Clojure

In the realm of Clojure-based web development, interacting with databases efficiently and effectively is paramount. While Clojure offers several libraries for this purpose, Yesql stands out as a unique tool that bridges the gap between SQL and Clojure with elegance and simplicity. This section delves into the intricacies of using Yesql, highlighting its differences from HugSQL, demonstrating how to map query results to Clojure data structures, handling complex queries, and optimizing performance for enterprise-level applications.

### Yesql Introduction

Yesql is a Clojure library that allows developers to write raw SQL queries in separate files and execute them from Clojure code. This approach contrasts with traditional Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries, which abstract SQL queries into high-level constructs. Yesql's philosophy is to embrace SQL's power and expressiveness, providing a straightforward way to integrate SQL queries directly into Clojure applications.

#### How Yesql Differs from HugSQL

Both Yesql and HugSQL are libraries that facilitate SQL integration in Clojure, but they have distinct approaches:

- **File-Based Query Management:** Yesql stores SQL queries in separate `.sql` files, allowing developers to maintain a clear separation between SQL and application logic. HugSQL also supports this but offers more advanced features like parameterized queries and result set transformations.

- **Simplicity vs. Flexibility:** Yesql is designed for simplicity, making it easy to execute SQL queries without extensive configuration. HugSQL, on the other hand, provides more flexibility with features like named parameters, result set transformations, and support for multiple dialects.

- **Use Cases:** Yesql is ideal for applications where SQL queries are straightforward and do not require complex transformations. HugSQL is better suited for applications that need advanced query features and transformations.

### Mapping Results: From SQL to Clojure Data Structures

One of Yesql's strengths is its ability to map SQL query results directly to Clojure data structures. This mapping is crucial for developers who want to leverage Clojure's powerful data manipulation capabilities.

#### Basic Query Execution

To execute a basic SQL query using Yesql, you first define the query in a `.sql` file:

```sql
-- queries.sql
-- :name get-users :? :*
SELECT * FROM users;
```

In the above example, `:name` specifies the function name (`get-users`) that will be generated in Clojure, and `:? :*` indicates that the query returns multiple rows.

Next, you load the query in your Clojure code:

```clojure
(ns myapp.db
  (:require [yesql.core :refer [defqueries]]))

(defqueries "queries.sql")
```

You can now call `get-users` to execute the query and receive the results as a sequence of maps:

```clojure
(defn fetch-users []
  (get-users db-spec))
```

Here, `db-spec` is a map containing the database connection details.

#### Mapping to Clojure Data Structures

Yesql automatically maps each row in the result set to a Clojure map, where column names become keys and column values become values. For example, a result set with columns `id`, `name`, and `email` will be mapped to a sequence of maps like:

```clojure
({:id 1, :name "Alice", :email "alice@example.com"}
 {:id 2, :name "Bob", :email "bob@example.com"})
```

This seamless mapping allows developers to leverage Clojure's rich set of functions for data manipulation, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### Complex Queries: Joins, Subqueries, and Stored Procedures

Real-world applications often require complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and stored procedures. Yesql provides a straightforward way to handle these scenarios.

#### Handling Joins

Consider a scenario where you need to join two tables, `users` and `orders`, to fetch users along with their orders:

```sql
-- :name get-users-with-orders :? :*
SELECT u.id, u.name, o.id AS order_id, o.total
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

This query can be executed in Clojure just like a simple query, with the results mapped to a sequence of maps:

```clojure
(defn fetch-users-with-orders []
  (get-users-with-orders db-spec))
```

#### Subqueries

Subqueries can be used to perform more complex data retrieval operations. For example, fetching users who have placed more than a certain number of orders:

```sql
-- :name get-frequent-users :? :*
SELECT u.id, u.name
FROM users u
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.user_id = u.id) > 5;
```

This query uses a subquery to count orders for each user, filtering those with more than five orders.

#### Stored Procedures

Yesql can also call stored procedures, although it requires a slightly different approach since stored procedures may not return result sets in the same way as standard queries. You can define a stored procedure call in your `.sql` file:

```sql
-- :name call-stored-procedure :! :1
CALL my_stored_procedure(:param1, :param2);
```

In this case, `:! :1` indicates that the query is a command (not a query) and returns a single result.

### Performance Optimization

Optimizing database interactions is crucial for maintaining high performance in enterprise applications. Yesql provides several strategies to achieve this.

#### Indexing and Query Optimization

Ensure that your database tables are properly indexed to speed up query execution. Use database-specific tools to analyze and optimize your queries.

#### Connection Pooling

Use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently. Libraries like `HikariCP` can be integrated with Yesql to provide robust connection pooling.

```clojure
(ns myapp.db
  (:require [hikari-cp.core :as hikari]))

(def db-spec
  {:datasource (hikari/make-datasource {:jdbc-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/mydb"
                                        :username "user"
                                        :password "pass"})})
```

#### Caching

Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on your database. Caching frequently accessed data in memory can significantly improve performance.

#### Batched Operations

For operations that involve inserting or updating multiple records, use batched operations to minimize the number of database round-trips.

### Conclusion

Yesql offers a powerful yet simple way to integrate SQL queries into Clojure applications, making it an excellent choice for developers who prefer to work directly with SQL. By understanding how to map query results to Clojure data structures, handle complex queries, and optimize performance, developers can build efficient and scalable applications.

Yesql's approach of embracing SQL's expressiveness while leveraging Clojure's functional programming capabilities provides a unique and effective solution for database interaction in enterprise applications.
