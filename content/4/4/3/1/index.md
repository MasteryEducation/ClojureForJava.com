## 4.3.1 Working with SQL using HugSQL

In the realm of enterprise software development, integrating with databases is a critical component of building robust applications. Clojure, with its functional programming paradigm, offers several libraries to facilitate database interactions. One such library that stands out for its simplicity and power is HugSQL. HugSQL provides a unique approach to SQL integration by allowing developers to embed SQL in separate files, promoting a clean separation of concerns and enhancing maintainability.

### HugSQL Overview

HugSQL is a Clojure library that bridges the gap between SQL and Clojure code by allowing SQL queries to be defined in external files. This approach not only keeps your Clojure codebase clean but also leverages the full power of SQL without compromising on the expressiveness of Clojure. HugSQL supports both positional and named parameters, making it flexible and easy to use.

#### Key Features of HugSQL

- **Separation of SQL and Code:** By placing SQL in separate files, HugSQL promotes a clear separation between your application logic and database queries.
- **Named and Positional Parameters:** HugSQL supports both named and positional parameters, providing flexibility in query definitions.
- **Rich SQL Features:** HugSQL allows you to use advanced SQL features like CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, and more.
- **Transaction Management:** HugSQL provides built-in support for managing database transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **Extensibility:** HugSQL can be extended with custom Clojure functions, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs.

### Defining Queries

Defining SQL queries with HugSQL involves creating a `.sql` file where you can write your SQL statements. These files are then parsed by HugSQL to generate Clojure functions that can be called within your application.

#### Creating a SQL File

Let's start by creating a simple SQL file named `queries.sql`. This file will contain a basic SQL query to retrieve user information from a `users` table.

```sql
-- :name get-user-by-id :? :1
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id;
```

In this example, `-- :name get-user-by-id :? :1` is a HugSQL directive that names the query `get-user-by-id` and specifies that it takes one parameter (`:id`).

#### Loading Queries in Clojure

To use the queries defined in your SQL file, you need to load them into your Clojure application. HugSQL provides a convenient function, `def-db-fns`, to accomplish this.

```clojure
(ns myapp.db
  (:require [hugsql.core :as hugsql]))

(hugsql/def-db-fns "queries.sql")
```

The `def-db-fns` macro reads the `queries.sql` file and generates Clojure functions for each query defined in the file. In this case, it will generate a function `get-user-by-id` that you can call from your Clojure code.

### Parameter Binding

HugSQL supports both named and positional parameters, allowing you to bind values to your SQL queries in a flexible manner.

#### Named Parameters

Named parameters are specified using a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name. In the SQL file, you define a named parameter like `:id`, and in your Clojure code, you pass a map with the parameter name as the key.

```clojure
(defn fetch-user-by-id [db id]
  (get-user-by-id db {:id id}))
```

In this example, `fetch-user-by-id` is a Clojure function that calls the `get-user-by-id` query, passing the `id` parameter as a map.

#### Positional Parameters

Positional parameters are specified using a question mark (`?`). They are useful when the order of parameters is fixed, and you want to avoid naming each parameter.

```sql
-- :name get-user-by-email :? :1
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?;
```

In your Clojure code, you can call this query by passing the parameters as a vector.

```clojure
(defn fetch-user-by-email [db email]
  (get-user-by-email db [email]))
```

### Transaction Management

Managing transactions is crucial for ensuring data consistency and integrity, especially in applications that perform multiple database operations. HugSQL provides built-in support for transactions, making it easy to group operations together.

#### Using Transactions in HugSQL

HugSQL leverages the underlying database connection library (such as `clojure.java.jdbc`) to manage transactions. You can use the `with-db-transaction` macro to execute a series of operations within a transaction.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(defn update-user-and-log [db user-id new-email]
  (jdbc/with-db-transaction [t-con db]
    (update-user-email t-con {:id user-id :email new-email})
    (log-email-change t-con {:user-id user-id :new-email new-email})))
```

In this example, `update-user-and-log` performs two operations: updating a user's email and logging the change. Both operations are executed within a transaction, ensuring that either both operations succeed or neither does.

### Practical Code Examples

To illustrate the power and flexibility of HugSQL, let's walk through a complete example of setting up a Clojure application with HugSQL, defining queries, and performing database operations.

#### Setting Up the Project

First, create a new Clojure project using Leiningen:

```bash
lein new app hugsql-example
```

Add the necessary dependencies to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
(defproject hugsql-example "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [com.layerware/hugsql "0.5.1"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.12"]
                 [org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.20"]])
```

#### Defining SQL Queries

Create a file named `resources/sql/queries.sql` and define your SQL queries:

```sql
-- :name get-all-users :?
SELECT * FROM users;

-- :name insert-user! :! :n
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (:name, :email);

-- :name update-user-email :! :n
UPDATE users SET email = :email WHERE id = :id;

-- :name delete-user :! :n
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = :id;
```

#### Loading and Using Queries

In your Clojure code, load the queries and define functions to interact with the database:

```clojure
(ns hugsql-example.core
  (:require [hugsql.core :as hugsql]
            [clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc]))

(hugsql/def-db-fns "sql/queries.sql")

(def db-spec {:dbtype "postgresql"
              :dbname "mydb"
              :user "myuser"
              :password "mypassword"})

(defn fetch-all-users []
  (get-all-users db-spec))

(defn add-user [name email]
  (insert-user! db-spec {:name name :email email}))

(defn change-user-email [id new-email]
  (update-user-email db-spec {:id id :email new-email}))

(defn remove-user [id]
  (delete-user db-spec {:id id}))
```

#### Running the Application

You can now run your Clojure application and perform database operations using the functions defined above. For example, to add a new user:

```clojure
(add-user "John Doe" "john.doe@example.com")
```

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- **Use Named Parameters:** Named parameters improve code readability and reduce the likelihood of errors when passing parameters to queries.
- **Leverage Transactions:** Use transactions to ensure data consistency, especially when performing multiple related operations.
- **Optimize Queries:** Regularly review and optimize your SQL queries to ensure they perform efficiently, especially as your database grows.
- **Handle Exceptions Gracefully:** Implement error handling to manage database exceptions and ensure your application can recover from failures.

### Common Pitfalls

- **SQL Injection:** Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **Connection Management:** Ensure that database connections are properly managed and closed to avoid resource leaks.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage database errors and ensure your application remains stable.

### Conclusion

HugSQL provides a powerful and flexible way to integrate SQL with Clojure applications. By separating SQL from your application logic, HugSQL promotes clean code and enhances maintainability. With support for named parameters, transactions, and advanced SQL features, HugSQL is a valuable tool for any Clojure developer working with databases.
