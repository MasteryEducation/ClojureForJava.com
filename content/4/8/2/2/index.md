## 8.2.2 Service Creation Basics

In the realm of modern web development, creating efficient and scalable services is paramount. Clojure, with its robust ecosystem, offers Pedestal—a powerful framework for building web services. This section will guide you through the essentials of service creation using Pedestal, focusing on defining services, setting up servers, and configuring your development environment for hot reloading. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid foundation for building and managing web services in Clojure.

### Defining Services

Defining a service in Pedestal involves setting up routes and handlers that dictate how your application responds to various HTTP requests. Let's walk through the process of creating a simple service.

#### Setting Up a New Pedestal Project

To begin, you'll need to create a new Pedestal project. You can use Leiningen, a popular build tool for Clojure, to scaffold a new project:

```bash
lein new pedestal-service my-service
```

This command generates a new Pedestal project named `my-service`, complete with a basic directory structure and configuration files.

#### Understanding the Project Structure

A typical Pedestal project consists of several key components:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for your application.
- **resources/**: Stores static resources like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **config/**: Holds configuration files for different environments.
- **project.clj**: The Leiningen project file, which specifies dependencies and build configurations.

#### Defining Routes and Handlers

Routes in Pedestal are defined using a data structure that maps HTTP methods and paths to handler functions. Let's define a simple route that responds to a GET request:

```clojure
(ns my-service.service
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]))

(defn home-page
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "Welcome to Pedestal!"})

(def routes
  #{["/" :get home-page]})

(def service
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})
```

In this example, we define a single route that maps the root URL (`"/"`) to a handler function `home-page`. The handler returns a simple HTTP response with a status code of 200 and a body containing a welcome message.

### Server Setup

Once you've defined your routes and handlers, the next step is to set up the Pedestal server to handle incoming requests.

#### Starting the Pedestal Server

Pedestal uses Jetty, a popular Java-based HTTP server, to serve requests. You can start the server using the following code:

```clojure
(ns my-service.server
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [my-service.service :as service]))

(defn start
  []
  (http/create-server service/service))

(defn -main
  [& args]
  (start))
```

To start the server, run the `-main` function. This will initialize the server and begin listening for requests on the specified port (8080 in our example).

#### Testing Endpoints

With the server running, you can test your endpoints using tools like `curl` or Postman. For example, to test the home page route, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

This should return the response "Welcome to Pedestal!" indicating that your service is up and running.

### Hot Reloading

During development, it's crucial to have a setup that allows for rapid iteration and testing. Hot reloading enables you to see changes in your code without restarting the server.

#### Setting Up Hot Reloading

To enable hot reloading in your Pedestal project, you'll need to use a tool like `tools.namespace` to reload namespaces automatically when changes are detected. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Update your `project.clj` to include `tools.namespace` and `reloaded.repl`:

    ```clojure
    :dependencies [[org.clojure/tools.namespace "1.0.0"]
                   [reloaded.repl "0.2.4"]]
    ```

2. **Configure Reloading**: Create a new namespace for managing reloading:

    ```clojure
    (ns my-service.dev
      (:require [clojure.tools.namespace.repl :refer [refresh]]
                [my-service.server :as server]))

    (defn start
      []
      (server/start))

    (defn reset
      []
      (refresh :after 'my-service.dev/start))
    ```

3. **Use the REPL**: Start a REPL session and use the `reset` function to reload your code:

    ```clojure
    (require 'my-service.dev)
    (my-service.dev/reset)
    ```

With this setup, any changes you make to your code will be automatically picked up, allowing you to test modifications quickly.

### Best Practices for Service Creation

When building services with Pedestal, consider the following best practices to ensure your application is robust and maintainable:

- **Modularize Your Code**: Break down your application into smaller, reusable components to improve maintainability and testability.
- **Use Middleware Wisely**: Leverage Pedestal's interceptor model to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling.
- **Optimize for Performance**: Profile your application to identify bottlenecks and optimize critical paths for better performance.
- **Secure Your Endpoints**: Implement security best practices, such as input validation and HTTPS, to protect your application from common vulnerabilities.

### Common Pitfalls and Optimization Tips

While working with Pedestal, be aware of common pitfalls and optimization opportunities:

- **Avoid Blocking Operations**: Use asynchronous programming techniques to prevent blocking the main thread, especially for I/O-bound tasks.
- **Manage State Carefully**: Ensure that shared state is managed properly to avoid concurrency issues.
- **Leverage Caching**: Use caching strategies to reduce load on your server and improve response times for frequently accessed resources.

### Conclusion

Creating services with Pedestal in Clojure is a powerful way to build scalable and efficient web applications. By understanding the basics of defining routes, setting up servers, and enabling hot reloading, you can streamline your development process and focus on delivering high-quality services. With best practices and optimization tips in mind, you're well-equipped to tackle the challenges of modern web development.
