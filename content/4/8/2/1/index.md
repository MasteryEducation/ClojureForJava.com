## 8.2.1 Project Configuration

In this section, we delve into the foundational aspects of setting up a Pedestal project using Leiningen, Clojure's popular build automation tool. We'll explore how to create a new project using templates, manage dependencies effectively, and understand the typical project structure that facilitates scalable and maintainable web services. This knowledge is crucial for developers aiming to leverage Pedestal for enterprise-level applications.

### Creating a New Pedestal Project with Leiningen

Leiningen simplifies the process of bootstrapping new Clojure projects through its templating system. For Pedestal, there are specific templates available that streamline the setup of a new web service. Here's how you can create a new Pedestal project:

1. **Install Leiningen**: Ensure that Leiningen is installed on your system. You can verify this by running `lein --version` in your terminal. If it's not installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://leiningen.org/#install).

2. **Generate a New Project**: Use the Pedestal service template to create a new project. Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   lein new pedestal-service my-pedestal-app
   ```

   This command will create a new directory named `my-pedestal-app` with a basic Pedestal service setup.

3. **Explore the Generated Project**: Navigate into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-pedestal-app
   ```

   Here, you'll find a pre-configured project with essential files and directories.

### Understanding Dependencies

Dependencies are crucial for any Clojure project, and Pedestal is no exception. The `project.clj` file is where you define these dependencies. Let's examine the typical dependencies required for a Pedestal project:

```clojure
(defproject my-pedestal-app "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A simple Pedestal web service"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [io.pedestal/pedestal.service "0.5.9"]
                 [io.pedestal/pedestal.jetty "0.5.9"]]
  :main ^{:skip-aot true} my-pedestal-app.core)
```

#### Key Dependencies:

- **Clojure**: The core language dependency. It's crucial to use a stable version, such as `1.10.3`, to ensure compatibility with other libraries.

- **Pedestal Service**: The core library for building web services. The version `0.5.9` is a stable release that includes essential features and bug fixes.

- **Pedestal Jetty**: This is the server adapter that allows Pedestal to run on the Jetty server. It's a common choice for development and production due to its performance and reliability.

### Project Structure

A well-organized project structure is vital for maintaining and scaling web services. Let's explore the typical directory layout and key files in a Pedestal project:

```
my-pedestal-app/
├── README.md
├── project.clj
├── resources/
│   └── config.edn
├── src/
│   └── my_pedestal_app/
│       ├── core.clj
│       ├── service.clj
│       └── routes.clj
└── test/
    └── my_pedestal_app/
        └── core_test.clj
```

#### Directory and File Breakdown:

- **README.md**: This file contains an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any other relevant information for developers.

- **project.clj**: The configuration file for Leiningen, specifying project metadata, dependencies, and build instructions.

- **resources/**: This directory holds configuration files and other static resources. The `config.edn` file typically contains environment-specific settings.

- **src/**: The source directory where your Clojure code resides. It follows a namespace-based structure.

  - **my_pedestal_app/core.clj**: The entry point of the application. This file usually contains the `-main` function and initializes the service.

  - **my_pedestal_app/service.clj**: Defines the service map, including routes, interceptors, and other configurations.

  - **my_pedestal_app/routes.clj**: Contains the routing logic, mapping HTTP requests to specific handlers.

- **test/**: The test directory mirrors the structure of `src/` and contains test cases for your application.

  - **my_pedestal_app/core_test.clj**: A sample test file to get you started with testing your application logic.

### Detailed Configuration in project.clj

The `project.clj` file is the heart of your project's configuration. Let's explore some advanced configurations you might consider:

#### Profiles

Leiningen supports profiles, which allow you to define different configurations for various environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

```clojure
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5"]
                                [ring/ring-mock "0.4.0"]]
                 :plugins [[lein-ring "0.12.5"]]}
           :uberjar {:aot :all}}
```

- **:dev**: This profile includes additional dependencies and plugins useful during development, such as `ring-mock` for testing HTTP requests.

- **:uberjar**: This profile is used for building an uberjar, a standalone JAR file that contains all dependencies and can be executed independently.

#### Aliases

Aliases are shortcuts for common Leiningen tasks. They can simplify your workflow by bundling commands together.

```clojure
:aliases {"run" ["trampoline" "run" "-m" "my-pedestal-app.core"]}
```

- **"run"**: This alias allows you to start the application with a simple `lein run` command, using the `trampoline` task to avoid starting a new JVM.

### Best Practices for Project Configuration

1. **Version Management**: Regularly update your dependencies to benefit from the latest features and security patches. Use tools like [lein-ancient](https://github.com/xsc/lein-ancient) to check for outdated dependencies.

2. **Environment Configuration**: Use environment variables or configuration files (e.g., `config.edn`) to manage environment-specific settings. This approach promotes separation of concerns and simplifies deployment.

3. **Code Organization**: Follow the namespace convention for organizing your code. This practice enhances readability and maintainability.

4. **Testing**: Set up a robust testing framework from the start. Use libraries like `clojure.test` and `midje` for unit testing, and consider property-based testing with `test.check`.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation within your codebase and external files like `README.md`. This practice aids onboarding and knowledge transfer.

### Common Pitfalls and Optimization Tips

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Be mindful of transitive dependencies that might introduce conflicts. Use the `lein deps :tree` command to visualize dependency hierarchies and resolve issues.

- **Performance Tuning**: Profile your application to identify bottlenecks. Tools like [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/) and [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) can provide insights into memory usage and CPU performance.

- **Security Considerations**: Regularly audit your dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Tools like [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) can automate this process.

### Conclusion

Configuring a Pedestal project with Leiningen sets the stage for developing robust and scalable web services. By understanding the project structure, managing dependencies effectively, and adhering to best practices, you can build applications that meet the demands of enterprise integration. As you continue to explore Pedestal, remember that a well-configured project is the foundation of successful software development.
