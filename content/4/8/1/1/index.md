## 8.1.1 Pedestal's Architecture and Components

Pedestal is a high-performance web framework designed for building robust and scalable web applications in Clojure. It stands out in the Clojure ecosystem due to its unique architecture, which emphasizes simplicity, composability, and performance. In this section, we will delve into the core components of Pedestal, explore its design philosophy, and compare it with other popular Clojure web frameworks such as Compojure and Luminus.

### Pedestal Overview

At the heart of Pedestal's architecture are three core components: routes, interceptors, and services. Each of these components plays a crucial role in how Pedestal applications are structured and executed.

#### Routes

Routes in Pedestal define the mapping between HTTP requests and the corresponding handlers. They are specified as a data structure, which allows for a high degree of flexibility and composability. This approach is different from traditional routing mechanisms found in other frameworks, where routes are often defined using macros or DSLs.

A typical route in Pedestal might look like this:

```clojure
(def routes
  #{["/hello" :get hello-world-handler]
    ["/goodbye" :post goodbye-handler]})
```

In this example, the `routes` set maps the `/hello` endpoint to the `hello-world-handler` function for GET requests, and the `/goodbye` endpoint to the `goodbye-handler` function for POST requests.

#### Interceptors

Interceptors are one of the most distinctive features of Pedestal. They provide a powerful mechanism for handling cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Interceptors are similar to middleware in other frameworks but offer more flexibility and control.

An interceptor in Pedestal is a map with `:enter`, `:leave`, and `:error` keys, each associated with a function. These functions are executed at different stages of request processing:

- **`:enter`**: Invoked when a request enters the interceptor chain.
- **`:leave`**: Invoked when a response leaves the interceptor chain.
- **`:error`**: Invoked if an error occurs during request processing.

Here's an example of a simple logging interceptor:

```clojure
(def logging-interceptor
  {:enter (fn [context]
            (println "Entering:" (:request context))
            context)
   :leave (fn [context]
            (println "Leaving:" (:response context))
            context)
   :error (fn [context error]
            (println "Error:" error)
            context)})
```

Interceptors can be composed into chains, allowing developers to build complex request processing pipelines with ease.

#### Services

Services in Pedestal are the entry points for handling HTTP requests. They are defined by combining routes and interceptors into a coherent unit that can be executed by the Pedestal server.

A service is typically defined using the `defservice` macro, which takes a map of options, including the routes and interceptors:

```clojure
(defservice my-service
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/interceptors [(body-params/body-params) logging-interceptor]
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})
```

In this example, `my-service` is configured to run in production mode, with a set of routes and interceptors, using Jetty as the HTTP server on port 8080.

### Design Philosophy

Pedestal's design philosophy revolves around three key principles: simplicity, composability, and performance.

#### Simplicity

Pedestal aims to keep things simple by using plain data structures and functions wherever possible. This simplicity is evident in the way routes are defined as data, and interceptors are composed into chains. By avoiding complex abstractions, Pedestal allows developers to focus on the core logic of their applications without getting bogged down in framework-specific details.

#### Composability

Composability is a central tenet of Pedestal's architecture. By using interceptors, developers can easily compose and reuse functionality across different parts of their applications. This composability extends to routes and services, allowing for modular and maintainable codebases.

#### Performance

Performance is a critical consideration in Pedestal's design. The framework is optimized for high throughput and low latency, making it well-suited for building high-performance web services. Pedestal achieves this by leveraging asynchronous processing and efficient data structures, ensuring that applications can handle large volumes of traffic with minimal overhead.

### Comparisons

Pedestal is not the only web framework available for Clojure developers. Two other popular frameworks are Compojure and Luminus. Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different use cases.

#### Pedestal vs. Compojure

Compojure is a lightweight routing library for Clojure web applications. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized projects. Compojure uses a DSL for defining routes, which can be more intuitive for developers familiar with traditional web frameworks.

However, Compojure lacks some of the advanced features found in Pedestal, such as interceptors and asynchronous processing. This makes Pedestal a better choice for applications that require complex request processing or need to handle high volumes of traffic.

#### Pedestal vs. Luminus

Luminus is a full-featured web framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools for building web applications in Clojure. It is built on top of several libraries, including Compojure, and offers features such as templating, database integration, and authentication out of the box.

While Luminus is a great choice for developers looking for a batteries-included framework, it can be more opinionated and less flexible than Pedestal. Pedestal's emphasis on simplicity and composability makes it a better fit for developers who prefer to build their applications from the ground up, using only the components they need.

### Practical Code Examples

To illustrate the concepts discussed above, let's walk through a simple example of building a Pedestal application.

#### Setting Up a Pedestal Project

First, create a new Pedestal project using Leiningen:

```bash
lein new pedestal-service my-pedestal-app
```

This will generate a basic Pedestal project structure with the necessary dependencies and configuration files.

#### Defining Routes and Handlers

Next, define the routes and handlers for your application. In the `src/my_pedestal_app/service.clj` file, add the following code:

```clojure
(ns my-pedestal-app.service
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]))

(defn hello-world-handler
  [request]
  {:status 200
   :body "Hello, World!"})

(def routes
  #{["/hello" :get hello-world-handler]})
```

This defines a single route that maps the `/hello` endpoint to the `hello-world-handler` function.

#### Adding Interceptors

Now, let's add a logging interceptor to the request processing pipeline. In the same file, add the following code:

```clojure
(def logging-interceptor
  {:enter (fn [context]
            (println "Entering:" (:request context))
            context)
   :leave (fn [context]
            (println "Leaving:" (:response context))
            context)})

(def interceptors [(http/default-interceptors)
                   logging-interceptor])
```

This interceptor will log the request and response for each incoming request.

#### Configuring the Service

Finally, configure the service to use the defined routes and interceptors. In the same file, add the following code:

```clojure
(def service
  {:env :prod
   ::http/routes routes
   ::http/interceptors interceptors
   ::http/type :jetty
   ::http/port 8080})
```

This sets up the service to run in production mode, using Jetty as the HTTP server on port 8080.

#### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
lein run
```

You should see output indicating that the server is running on port 8080. You can test the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/hello` in your web browser, where you should see the message "Hello, World!".

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

When working with Pedestal, there are several best practices and optimization tips to keep in mind:

- **Use Interceptors Wisely**: Interceptors are a powerful tool, but they can also add complexity to your application. Use them judiciously to handle cross-cutting concerns, and avoid overusing them for simple tasks that can be handled directly in handlers.

- **Leverage Asynchronous Processing**: Pedestal's support for asynchronous processing can significantly improve the performance of your application. Use asynchronous handlers and interceptors to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main request processing thread.

- **Optimize Route Definitions**: Keep your route definitions simple and organized. Use data-driven routing to take advantage of Pedestal's composability and flexibility.

- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly monitor the performance of your application using tools such as VisualVM or Prometheus. Identify and address bottlenecks to ensure your application remains responsive under load.

### Conclusion

Pedestal is a powerful and flexible web framework that offers a unique approach to building web applications in Clojure. Its emphasis on simplicity, composability, and performance makes it an excellent choice for developers looking to build high-performance web services. By understanding Pedestal's architecture and components, you can leverage its strengths to build robust and scalable applications.
