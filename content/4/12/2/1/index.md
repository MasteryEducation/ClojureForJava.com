## 12.2.1 Leveraging `ex-info` and `ex-data` in Clojure for Enhanced Error Handling

In the realm of enterprise software development, robust error handling is paramount. Clojure, with its functional programming paradigm, offers powerful tools for managing exceptions. Among these tools, `ex-info` and `ex-data` stand out for their ability to create rich, informative exceptions that can greatly enhance the debugging process. This section delves into the intricacies of using `ex-info` and `ex-data`, providing you with the knowledge to implement effective error handling strategies in your Clojure applications.

### Understanding `ex-info` and `ex-data`

Clojure's `ex-info` function is a versatile tool for creating exceptions that carry not just a message, but also a map of additional data. This capability allows developers to attach contextual information to exceptions, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Creating Exceptions with `ex-info`

The `ex-info` function is used to create an instance of `clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo`, a subclass of `java.lang.Exception`. This function takes three arguments:

1. **Message**: A string describing the error.
2. **Data Map**: A map containing additional context about the error.
3. **Cause (optional)**: Another throwable that caused this exception.

Here's a simple example of creating an exception using `ex-info`:

```clojure
(defn divide [numerator denominator]
  (if (zero? denominator)
    (throw (ex-info "Division by zero" {:numerator numerator :denominator denominator}))
    (/ numerator denominator)))

;; Usage
(try
  (divide 10 0)
  (catch Exception e
    (println "Caught exception:" (.getMessage e))
    (println "Exception data:" (ex-data e))))
```

In this example, an exception is thrown if the denominator is zero, and the `ex-info` function is used to attach the numerator and denominator as context.

#### Attaching Context with `ex-data`

The `ex-data` function retrieves the data map attached to an exception created with `ex-info`. This map can contain any relevant information that might help in understanding the error's context.

Consider the following scenario where additional context is crucial:

```clojure
(defn process-order [order]
  (if (nil? (:customer-id order))
    (throw (ex-info "Missing customer ID" {:order order}))
    ;; Process the order
    ))

;; Usage
(try
  (process-order {:order-id 123})
  (catch Exception e
    (println "Caught exception:" (.getMessage e))
    (println "Exception data:" (ex-data e))))
```

Here, if an order lacks a customer ID, an exception is thrown with the entire order map attached as context. This approach ensures that when an error occurs, all relevant information is readily available for debugging.

### Catching Exceptions with `try` / `catch`

Handling exceptions in Clojure involves using the `try` / `catch` construct, similar to Java. This construct allows you to gracefully manage errors and execute alternative logic or cleanup operations.

#### Example of Exception Handling

Let's expand on the previous examples to demonstrate how to catch and handle exceptions:

```clojure
(defn safe-divide [numerator denominator]
  (try
    (divide numerator denominator)
    (catch Exception e
      (let [data (ex-data e)]
        (println "Error:" (.getMessage e))
        (println "Numerator:" (:numerator data))
        (println "Denominator:" (:denominator data))
        :error))))

;; Usage
(safe-divide 10 0)
```

In this example, the `safe-divide` function attempts to divide two numbers and catches any exceptions that occur. The exception's message and data are printed, providing insights into what went wrong.

### Best Practices for Using `ex-info` and `ex-data`

1. **Consistent Data Structure**: Ensure that the data map follows a consistent structure across your application. This consistency aids in automated logging and monitoring systems.

2. **Meaningful Messages**: Craft exception messages that are clear and informative. They should provide enough context to understand the error without needing to inspect the data map.

3. **Granular Context**: Attach only relevant information to the data map. Avoid including large or sensitive data unless necessary, as this can clutter logs and pose security risks.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate exception handling with your logging and monitoring infrastructure. Use tools like [Timbre](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre) for logging exceptions and their data in a structured format.

5. **Testing Exception Scenarios**: Write tests that simulate error conditions to ensure your exception handling logic works as expected. Use libraries like [clojure.test](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html) for unit testing.

### Advanced Usage and Patterns

#### Nested Exceptions

In complex systems, exceptions can be nested, where one exception is the cause of another. `ex-info` allows you to specify a cause, enabling you to create a chain of exceptions that reflect the error's propagation through the system.

```clojure
(defn read-file [filename]
  (try
    ;; Simulate file reading
    (throw (java.io.IOException. "File not found"))
    (catch java.io.IOException e
      (throw (ex-info "Failed to read file" {:filename filename} e)))))

;; Usage
(try
  (read-file "nonexistent.txt")
  (catch Exception e
    (println "Caught exception:" (.getMessage e))
    (println "Exception data:" (ex-data e))
    (println "Cause:" (.getCause e))))
```

In this example, a `java.io.IOException` is caught and wrapped in an `ex-info` exception, preserving the original exception as the cause.

#### Custom Exception Types

While `ex-info` is versatile, there might be cases where you need custom exception types for specific error categories. You can define your own exception classes in Clojure or Java and use them alongside `ex-info`.

```clojure
(deftype MyCustomException [message data]
  clojure.lang.IExceptionInfo
  (getMessage [this] message)
  (getData [this] data))

(defn risky-operation []
  (throw (MyCustomException. "Custom error" {:code 123})))

;; Usage
(try
  (risky-operation)
  (catch MyCustomException e
    (println "Caught custom exception:" (.getMessage e))
    (println "Exception data:" (.getData e))))
```

This approach allows you to leverage the benefits of `ex-info` while introducing domain-specific exception types.

### Conclusion

Leveraging `ex-info` and `ex-data` in Clojure provides a powerful mechanism for creating and managing exceptions with rich contextual information. By attaching relevant data to exceptions, you can significantly enhance the debugging process and improve the resilience of your applications. As you integrate these practices into your development workflow, you'll find that handling errors becomes a more structured and insightful process.
