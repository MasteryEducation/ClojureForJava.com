## 10.5.1 Creating Uberjars

In the realm of Clojure development, the concept of an "uberjar" plays a pivotal role in simplifying the deployment process. This section delves into the intricacies of creating uberjars using Leiningen, a popular build automation tool for Clojure projects. We will explore the benefits of using uberjars, provide step-by-step instructions for creating them, and discuss how to manage dependencies effectively. By the end of this section, you will have a thorough understanding of how to leverage uberjars for enterprise integration and deployment.

### Understanding the Uberjar Concept

An "uberjar" is a JAR (Java Archive) file that contains not only your compiled Clojure code but also all the dependencies required to run your application. This self-contained package simplifies the deployment process by eliminating the need to manage external dependencies separately. The term "uberjar" is derived from the German word "über," meaning "over" or "above," signifying that it is a JAR file that includes everything needed to run the application.

#### Advantages of Using Uberjars

1. **Simplified Deployment:** With all dependencies bundled into a single file, deploying your application becomes a straightforward process. You only need to transfer one file to the target environment, reducing the risk of missing dependencies.

2. **Consistency Across Environments:** Uberjars ensure that the same versions of libraries are used in development, testing, and production environments, minimizing compatibility issues.

3. **Ease of Distribution:** Distributing a single JAR file is more convenient than managing multiple files or dependencies, especially in environments where network access is restricted.

4. **Improved Portability:** Since an uberjar contains everything needed to run the application, it can be executed on any system with a compatible Java Runtime Environment (JRE), making it highly portable.

5. **Version Control:** By encapsulating all dependencies within the JAR, you can easily manage and track specific versions of your application.

### Creating an Uberjar with Leiningen

Leiningen is a build automation tool specifically designed for Clojure projects. It simplifies tasks such as dependency management, project configuration, and building artifacts like uberjars. Creating an uberjar with Leiningen involves a few straightforward steps.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Uberjar

1. **Set Up Your Project:**

   Ensure that your Clojure project is properly set up with a `project.clj` file. This file contains metadata about your project, including dependencies, build configurations, and other settings.

   ```clojure
   (defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
     :description "A sample Clojure application"
     :url "http://example.com/my-clojure-app"
     :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
               :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
     :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                    [ring/ring-core "1.9.0"]
                    [compojure "1.6.2"]]
     :main ^:skip-aot my-clojure-app.core
     :target-path "target/%s"
     :profiles {:uberjar {:aot :all}})
   ```

   In this example, the `:main` key specifies the namespace containing the `-main` function, which serves as the entry point for the application. The `:profiles` key is used to define build-specific configurations, such as the `:uberjar` profile, which includes Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation settings.

2. **Compile the Project:**

   Before creating the uberjar, compile the project to ensure that all Clojure code is translated into Java bytecode. This step is crucial for including the compiled classes in the final JAR file.

   ```bash
   lein compile
   ```

3. **Create the Uberjar:**

   Use the `lein uberjar` command to generate the uberjar. This command compiles the project (if not already compiled) and packages it along with all dependencies into a single JAR file.

   ```bash
   lein uberjar
   ```

   Upon successful execution, Leiningen will create the uberjar in the `target` directory. The file name typically includes the project name and version, such as `my-clojure-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`.

4. **Run the Uberjar:**

   To execute the application from the uberjar, use the `java -jar` command followed by the path to the JAR file.

   ```bash
   java -jar target/my-clojure-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
   ```

   This command launches the application, starting with the `-main` function specified in the `project.clj` file.

### Excluding Dependencies from the Uberjar

In some cases, you may want to exclude certain files or dependencies from the uberjar. This can be useful for reducing the size of the JAR file or avoiding conflicts with libraries provided by the runtime environment.

#### Excluding Files and Directories

To exclude specific files or directories from the uberjar, you can use the `:uberjar-exclusions` key in the `project.clj` file. This key accepts a regular expression pattern that matches the files or directories to be excluded.

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  ;; ...
  :uberjar-exclusions [#"log4j.properties" #"META-INF/.*"])
```

In this example, the `log4j.properties` file and any files in the `META-INF` directory are excluded from the uberjar.

#### Excluding Dependencies

To exclude specific dependencies, you can use the `:exclusions` key within the dependency vector. This is particularly useful when you want to avoid including transitive dependencies that are already provided by the runtime environment.

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [ring/ring-core "1.9.0" :exclusions [org.clojure/tools.logging]]
                 [compojure "1.6.2"]])
```

In this example, the `tools.logging` library is excluded from the `ring-core` dependency.

### Best Practices for Creating Uberjars

1. **Minimize the Size of the Uberjar:**

   Exclude unnecessary files and dependencies to reduce the size of the uberjar. This not only saves storage space but also improves the startup time of the application.

2. **Use AOT Compilation Wisely:**

   While AOT compilation can improve startup time, it may also increase the size of the uberjar. Consider compiling only the namespaces that benefit from AOT, such as those containing the `-main` function.

3. **Test the Uberjar Thoroughly:**

   Before deploying the uberjar to production, test it in a staging environment to ensure that all dependencies are correctly included and that the application behaves as expected.

4. **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**

   Regularly update your dependencies to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. Use tools like `lein ancient` to check for outdated dependencies.

5. **Document the Build Process:**

   Maintain clear documentation of the build process, including any custom configurations or exclusions. This ensures that other team members can easily reproduce the build.

### Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Dependencies:**

   If the application fails to start due to missing dependencies, verify that all required libraries are included in the `project.clj` file and that there are no conflicting versions.

2. **Classpath Conflicts:**

   Classpath conflicts can occur when multiple versions of the same library are included in the uberjar. Use the `lein deps :tree` command to inspect the dependency tree and resolve conflicts.

3. **Large Uberjar Size:**

   If the uberjar is excessively large, review the included dependencies and exclusions. Consider using the `:uberjar-exclusions` key to remove unnecessary files.

4. **AOT Compilation Errors:**

   AOT compilation can sometimes lead to errors if the code relies on dynamic features of Clojure. Review the affected namespaces and adjust the AOT settings as needed.

### Conclusion

Creating uberjars with Leiningen is a powerful technique for simplifying the deployment of Clojure applications. By bundling all dependencies into a single JAR file, you can streamline the deployment process, ensure consistency across environments, and improve the portability of your applications. By following the best practices outlined in this section, you can effectively leverage uberjars for enterprise integration and deployment.
