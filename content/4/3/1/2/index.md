## 3.1.2 Handling Requests and Responses

In the realm of web development, handling HTTP requests and crafting appropriate responses are fundamental tasks. Clojure, with its minimalist and expressive syntax, offers powerful abstractions for these tasks through libraries like Ring and Compojure. This section delves into the mechanics of request handling and response construction, providing you with the knowledge to build robust web applications in Clojure.

### Understanding HTTP Requests

HTTP requests are the starting point of any web interaction. They carry essential information such as the requested URL, HTTP method, headers, and body content. In Clojure, Ring provides a simple yet powerful abstraction for dealing with HTTP requests.

#### Accessing Request Data

When a request hits your Clojure web application, it is represented as a map containing various keys that provide access to different parts of the request. Here's a breakdown of how to access common request data:

- **Headers**: The `:headers` key contains a map of request headers.
- **Parameters**: Query parameters are accessible via the `:query-params` key, while form parameters are found under `:form-params`.
- **Body**: The `:body` key holds the request body, typically as an input stream.

Let's explore how to access these components with a practical example:

```clojure
(ns myapp.core
  (:require [ring.util.response :as response]))

(defn handle-request [request]
  (let [headers (:headers request)
        query-params (:query-params request)
        form-params (:form-params request)
        body (slurp (:body request))]
    (println "Headers:" headers)
    (println "Query Params:" query-params)
    (println "Form Params:" form-params)
    (println "Body:" body)
    (response/response "Request data logged.")))
```

In this example, we define a handler function `handle-request` that logs various parts of the incoming request. The `slurp` function is used to read the body input stream into a string.

### Constructing HTTP Responses

Once a request is processed, the next step is to construct a response. Ring responses are also represented as maps, typically containing keys like `:status`, `:headers`, and `:body`.

#### Creating Responses with Different Content Types

Clojure's Ring library allows you to easily create responses with various content types, such as HTML, JSON, and XML. Here's how you can construct responses with different content types:

- **HTML Response**:

```clojure
(defn html-response []
  (-> (response/response "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
      (response/content-type "text/html")))
```

- **JSON Response**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.json
  (:require [cheshire.core :as json]
            [ring.util.response :as response]))

(defn json-response [data]
  (-> (response/response (json/generate-string data))
      (response/content-type "application/json")))
```

- **XML Response**:

```clojure
(ns myapp.xml
  (:require [clojure.data.xml :as xml]
            [ring.util.response :as response]))

(defn xml-response [data]
  (let [xml-str (xml/emit-str data)]
    (-> (response/response xml-str)
        (response/content-type "application/xml"))))
```

In these examples, we use helper libraries like Cheshire for JSON and `clojure.data.xml` for XML to convert data structures into the desired format.

### Handling HTTP Methods and Status Codes

HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) dictate the action to be performed on a resource. In Clojure, you can handle different methods using Compojure's routing capabilities.

#### Example: Handling Different HTTP Methods

```clojure
(ns myapp.routes
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [ring.util.response :as response]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/resource" [] (response/response "GET request received"))
  (POST "/resource" [] (response/response "POST request received"))
  (PUT "/resource" [] (response/response "PUT request received"))
  (DELETE "/resource" [] (response/response "DELETE request received")))
```

In this example, we define routes for handling different HTTP methods on the `/resource` endpoint. Each route returns a simple response indicating the method received.

#### Setting Status Codes

HTTP status codes convey the result of the request processing. You can set the status code in the response map using the `:status` key:

```clojure
(defn custom-status-response []
  {:status 404
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/plain"}
   :body "Resource not found"})
```

This response sets a 404 status code, indicating that the requested resource was not found.

### Exception Handling in Handlers

Robust web applications must gracefully handle errors and exceptions. In Clojure, you can manage exceptions within handlers using try-catch blocks or middleware.

#### Example: Handling Exceptions in Handlers

```clojure
(defn safe-handler [request]
  (try
    (let [result (process-request request)]
      (response/response result))
    (catch Exception e
      (response/status (response/response "Internal Server Error") 500))))
```

In this example, the `safe-handler` function wraps the request processing logic in a `try-catch` block. If an exception occurs, a 500 status code is returned with an error message.

#### Middleware for Error Handling

Middleware can also be used to handle errors globally across your application. Here's an example of a simple error-handling middleware:

```clojure
(defn wrap-error-handling [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (try
      (handler request)
      (catch Exception e
        (response/status (response/response "Internal Server Error") 500)))))
```

By wrapping your handler with `wrap-error-handling`, you ensure that any unhandled exceptions result in a 500 error response.

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

- **Use Middleware for Common Tasks**: Leverage middleware for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling to keep your handlers clean and focused.
- **Optimize JSON/XML Serialization**: Use efficient libraries like Cheshire for JSON and `clojure.data.xml` for XML to minimize serialization overhead.
- **Handle Large Request Bodies Efficiently**: For large request bodies, consider streaming data processing to avoid loading entire content into memory.
- **Secure Your Endpoints**: Implement security measures such as input validation, CSRF protection, and secure headers to safeguard your application.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring Request Body Streams**: Always ensure that the request body stream is consumed, as failing to do so can lead to resource leaks.
- **Mismatched Content Types**: Ensure that the `Content-Type` header in responses matches the actual content to prevent client-side parsing errors.
- **Uncaught Exceptions**: Unhandled exceptions can lead to server crashes or undefined behavior. Always use try-catch blocks or middleware to manage exceptions.

### Conclusion

Handling requests and responses effectively is crucial for building reliable and performant web applications. By understanding the nuances of request data access, response construction, and error management, you can create robust Clojure applications that meet enterprise standards. The examples and best practices outlined in this section provide a solid foundation for mastering these essential tasks.
