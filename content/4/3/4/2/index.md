## 3.4.2 CSRF Protection and Secure Headers

In the realm of web security, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and the implementation of secure headers are critical components in safeguarding web applications. This section delves into the nature of CSRF attacks, explores methods to protect against them using Clojure's web development tools, and discusses the importance of secure headers in enhancing application security.

### Understanding CSRF Attacks

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. This can lead to unauthorized transactions, data breaches, and other malicious activities. CSRF exploits the trust that a web application has in the user's browser, making it a significant threat to web security.

#### Potential Impact of CSRF Attacks

The impact of a successful CSRF attack can be severe, including:

- **Unauthorized Transactions:** Attackers can initiate transactions on behalf of the user, such as transferring funds or changing account settings.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive information can be exposed or altered without the user's consent.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** Attackers can gain control over user accounts, leading to further exploitation.

### CSRF Protection Methods

To mitigate the risk of CSRF attacks, developers can implement several protective measures. In Clojure, the `wrap-anti-forgery` middleware is a robust solution for CSRF protection.

#### Introducing `wrap-anti-forgery` Middleware

The `wrap-anti-forgery` middleware is part of the Ring library, which provides a simple yet effective way to protect against CSRF attacks. It works by generating a unique token for each session, which must be included in any state-changing request (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE).

##### Implementing `wrap-anti-forgery`

To implement CSRF protection using `wrap-anti-forgery`, follow these steps:

1. **Add Dependency:**

   Ensure that the Ring library is included in your `project.clj` file:

   ```clojure
   [ring/ring-anti-forgery "1.3.0"]
   ```

2. **Wrap Your Handlers:**

   Use the `wrap-anti-forgery` middleware in your application:

   ```clojure
   (require '[ring.middleware.anti-forgery :refer [wrap-anti-forgery]])

   (def app
     (-> your-handler
         wrap-anti-forgery))
   ```

3. **Include CSRF Token in Forms:**

   Ensure that your HTML forms include the CSRF token:

   ```html
   <form action="/submit" method="post">
     <input type="hidden" name="__anti-forgery-token" value="{{csrf-token}}">
     <!-- Other form fields -->
   </form>
   ```

   The `csrf-token` can be injected into your templates using a templating engine like Selmer.

##### Handling CSRF Token Errors

When a request lacks a valid CSRF token, the middleware will return a 403 Forbidden response. It's essential to handle these errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user.

```clojure
(defn handle-csrf-error [request]
  {:status 403
   :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
   :body "CSRF token is missing or invalid."})

(def app
  (-> your-handler
      wrap-anti-forgery
      (wrap-defaults site-defaults)
      (wrap-error-page handle-csrf-error)))
```

### Enhancing Security with Secure Headers

In addition to CSRF protection, implementing secure headers is crucial for defending against various web vulnerabilities. Secure headers instruct the browser on how to handle the content and interactions with the server, thereby reducing the attack surface.

#### Key Security Headers

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):**

   The `Strict-Transport-Security` header enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to the server. It prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

   ```clojure
   (defn wrap-hsts [handler]
     (fn [request]
       (let [response (handler request)]
         (assoc-in response [:headers "Strict-Transport-Security"] "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"))))
   ```

2. **X-Content-Type-Options:**

   The `X-Content-Type-Options` header prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type. This helps mitigate attacks like drive-by downloads.

   ```clojure
   (defn wrap-content-type-options [handler]
     (fn [request]
       (let [response (handler request)]
         (assoc-in response [:headers "X-Content-Type-Options"] "nosniff"))))
   ```

3. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**

   CSP is a powerful tool to prevent XSS attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

   ```clojure
   (defn wrap-csp [handler]
     (fn [request]
       (let [response (handler request)]
         (assoc-in response [:headers "Content-Security-Policy"] "default-src 'self'"))))
   ```

4. **X-Frame-Options:**

   This header protects against clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a page can be displayed in a frame.

   ```clojure
   (defn wrap-frame-options [handler]
     (fn [request]
       (let [response (handler request)]
         (assoc-in response [:headers "X-Frame-Options"] "DENY"))))
   ```

### Best Practices for Securing Web Applications

Implementing CSRF protection and secure headers is just part of a comprehensive security strategy. Here are additional best practices to enhance your application's security:

1. **Regular Security Audits:**

   Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses.

2. **Keep Dependencies Updated:**

   Regularly update your libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

3. **Use HTTPS Everywhere:**

   Ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.

4. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**

   Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

5. **Implement Rate Limiting:**

   Protect against brute force attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame.

6. **Monitor and Log Security Events:**

   Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.

### Conclusion

Securing your Clojure web applications against CSRF attacks and enhancing security with secure headers are critical steps in protecting your users and data. By implementing the strategies outlined in this section, you can significantly reduce the risk of common web vulnerabilities and build robust, secure applications.
