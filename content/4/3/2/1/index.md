## 3.2.1 Defining Routes and Handlers

In the realm of Clojure web development, Compojure stands out as a robust routing library that simplifies the process of defining routes and handlers. This section delves into the essential aspects of using Compojure to create efficient and organized web applications. We'll cover basic routing, nested routes, route prioritization, and best practices for crafting handler functions.

### Basic Routing with Compojure

Compojure provides a set of macros that make defining routes straightforward and intuitive. At its core, a route in Compojure is a mapping between an HTTP request and a handler function. The `defroutes` macro is commonly used to define a collection of routes.

#### Simple Route Definitions

Let's start by defining a few basic routes using Compojure:

```clojure
(ns myapp.routes
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [ring.util.response :refer :all]))

(defn home-page []
  (response "Welcome to the Home Page"))

(defn about-page []
  (response "About Us"))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] (home-page))
  (GET "/about" [] (about-page))
  (POST "/submit" [] (response "Form Submitted")))
```

In this example, we define three routes:

- A `GET` request to `/` invokes the `home-page` handler.
- A `GET` request to `/about` invokes the `about-page` handler.
- A `POST` request to `/submit` returns a simple response.

#### Understanding Compojure Macros

Compojure provides several macros for defining routes, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `ANY`. Each macro corresponds to an HTTP method, allowing you to specify the type of request the route should handle.

### Nested Routes for Better Organization

As applications grow, managing routes can become cumbersome. Compojure allows you to nest routes, which helps in organizing them logically and hierarchically.

#### Implementing Nested Routes

Consider an application with user-related routes. We can group these routes under a common prefix using the `context` macro:

```clojure
(defn user-profile [id]
  (response (str "User Profile for ID: " id)))

(defroutes user-routes
  (GET "/:id" [id] (user-profile id))
  (POST "/:id/update" [id] (response (str "Update User " id))))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] (home-page))
  (context "/users" [] user-routes))
```

Here, the `context` macro is used to group all user-related routes under the `/users` path. This approach enhances readability and maintainability, especially in larger applications.

### Route Prioritization: Order and Specificity

The order of route definitions in Compojure is crucial. Routes are evaluated in the order they are defined, and the first matching route is selected. This behavior necessitates careful consideration of route specificity and order.

#### Importance of Route Order

Consider the following example:

```clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/users/:id" [id] (response (str "User ID: " id)))
  (GET "/users/all" [] (response "All Users")))
```

In this case, the route `/users/:id` will match any `/users/*` path, including `/users/all`. To ensure `/users/all` is matched correctly, it should be defined before the more generic `/users/:id` route:

```clojure
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/users/all" [] (response "All Users"))
  (GET "/users/:id" [id] (response (str "User ID: " id))))
```

#### Specificity in Route Definitions

When defining routes, more specific routes should precede less specific ones. This practice prevents unintended matches and ensures the correct handler is invoked.

### Handler Functions: Best Practices

Handler functions are the backbone of a Compojure application. They process requests and generate responses. Writing clean, reusable handler functions is essential for maintaining a scalable codebase.

#### Writing Clean Handlers

Here are some best practices for writing handler functions:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Keep business logic separate from HTTP-specific code. Use helper functions or services to handle complex logic.

2. **Parameter Destructuring:** Leverage Clojure's destructuring capabilities to extract parameters from requests cleanly.

   ```clojure
   (defn user-profile [{:keys [params]}]
     (let [id (get params "id")]
       (response (str "User Profile for ID: " id))))
   ```

3. **Middleware Utilization:** Use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling, keeping handlers focused on their core responsibilities.

4. **Consistent Response Format:** Ensure all handlers return responses in a consistent format, whether it's plain text, JSON, or HTML.

#### Reusable Handler Functions

To promote code reuse, consider creating higher-order functions or macros that encapsulate common patterns. For example, a macro to handle JSON responses:

```clojure
(defmacro json-response [body]
  `(-> (response ~body)
       (content-type "application/json")))

(defn user-profile [id]
  (json-response {:id id :name "John Doe"}))
```

### Conclusion

Defining routes and handlers in Compojure is a fundamental aspect of building web applications in Clojure. By understanding basic routing, leveraging nested routes, prioritizing route order, and adhering to best practices for handler functions, developers can create robust and maintainable applications. As you continue to explore Compojure, remember that clarity and organization in your route definitions will greatly enhance the scalability and readability of your codebase.
