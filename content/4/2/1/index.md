## 2.1 Installing Clojure and Leiningen

Clojure, a modern, dynamic, and functional dialect of the Lisp programming language, has gained significant traction in enterprise environments due to its robust features and seamless Java interoperability. To harness the power of Clojure for enterprise integration, it's crucial to set up a development environment that includes both Clojure and Leiningen, the de facto build automation tool for Clojure projects. This section provides a comprehensive guide to installing Clojure and Leiningen across different operating systems, configuring the necessary environment variables, verifying the installations, and troubleshooting common issues.

### Installation Steps

#### Installing Clojure and Leiningen on Windows

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. Clojure requires Java 8 or later. You can download it from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

2. **Install Clojure:**
   - Download the Windows installer from the [Clojure official website](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. The installer will add the `clojure` command to your system PATH.

3. **Install Leiningen:**
   - Download the `lein.bat` script from the [Leiningen website](https://leiningen.org/).
   - Place `lein.bat` in a directory included in your system PATH, such as `C:\Program Files\Leiningen`.
   - Open a command prompt and run `lein self-install`. This command downloads the necessary Leiningen jar files.

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your JDK installation directory. For example:
     ```shell
     setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.10"
     ```
   - Ensure the `PATH` environment variable includes the directories for Java, Clojure, and Leiningen.

#### Installing Clojure and Leiningen on macOS

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - macOS comes with a pre-installed version of Java, but it's advisable to install the latest JDK using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following command:
     ```shell
     brew install openjdk
     ```

2. **Install Clojure:**
   - Use Homebrew to install Clojure:
     ```shell
     brew install clojure/tools/clojure
     ```

3. **Install Leiningen:**
   - Again, use Homebrew:
     ```shell
     brew install leiningen
     ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by adding the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` file:
     ```shell
     export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
     ```
   - Ensure the `PATH` includes `/usr/local/bin` where Homebrew installs binaries.

#### Installing Clojure and Leiningen on Linux

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Install the JDK. For Ubuntu, you can use:
     ```shell
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
     ```

2. **Install Clojure:**
   - Download and run the installation script:
     ```shell
     curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.3.1029.sh
     chmod +x linux-install-1.10.3.1029.sh
     sudo ./linux-install-1.10.3.1029.sh
     ```

3. **Install Leiningen:**
   - Download the `lein` script:
     ```shell
     curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
     chmod +x lein
     sudo mv lein /usr/local/bin/
     ```
   - Run `lein` to complete the installation:
     ```shell
     lein
     ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   - Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:
     ```shell
     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
     ```

### Verification

After installation, it's essential to verify that both Clojure and Leiningen are correctly installed and accessible from the command line.

- **Verify Clojure Installation:**
  ```shell
  clojure -M
  ```
  This command should start a Clojure REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), indicating that Clojure is installed correctly.

- **Verify Leiningen Installation:**
  ```shell
  lein --version
  ```
  This command should output the version of Leiningen installed, confirming a successful installation.

### Troubleshooting Tips

Even with careful installation, you might encounter issues. Here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Java Not Found:**
   - Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly and that the JDK's `bin` directory is included in your `PATH`.

2. **Clojure Command Not Found:**
   - Verify that the Clojure installation directory is included in your `PATH`.

3. **Leiningen Fails to Download Dependencies:**
   - Check your internet connection and ensure that your firewall or proxy settings allow access to external Maven repositories.

4. **Permission Issues on Linux:**
   - Ensure that the `lein` script is executable and located in a directory included in your `PATH`.

5. **Version Conflicts:**
   - If multiple versions of Java or Clojure are installed, ensure that the correct version is prioritized in your `PATH`.

### Conclusion

Setting up Clojure and Leiningen is a crucial step in leveraging the full potential of Clojure for enterprise integration. By following the detailed installation instructions provided for Windows, macOS, and Linux, configuring the necessary environment variables, and verifying the installations, you can ensure a smooth development experience. Additionally, the troubleshooting tips will help you resolve common issues, allowing you to focus on building robust and scalable applications with Clojure.
