## 13.5.1 Externalizing Configuration

In modern software development, the separation of configuration from code is a crucial practice that enhances flexibility, security, and scalability. This principle is prominently advocated by the [12-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/config), which emphasizes storing configuration in the environment. This approach not only simplifies deployment across different environments but also ensures that sensitive information is kept out of the source code. In this section, we will explore various strategies and tools for externalizing configuration in Clojure applications, including the use of environment variables, configuration files, and libraries like `env` and `cprop`.

### The Importance of Externalizing Configuration

Externalizing configuration refers to the practice of separating configuration data from the application code. This separation allows for:

- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Different environments (development, testing, production) can have distinct configurations without altering the codebase.
- **Security**: Sensitive data such as API keys and database credentials are not hard-coded, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Configuration changes do not require code changes, facilitating easier scaling and deployment.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are a common method for externalizing configuration. They are supported by all operating systems and provide a straightforward way to pass configuration data to applications.

#### Setting Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set in various ways depending on the operating system and deployment environment:

- **Unix/Linux/MacOS**: Use the `export` command in the terminal or set variables in shell configuration files like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
  
  ```bash
  export DATABASE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
  export API_KEY="your-api-key"
  ```

- **Windows**: Use the `set` command in the command prompt or configure them in the System Properties.

  ```cmd
  set DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
  set API_KEY=your-api-key
  ```

- **Docker**: Use the `-e` flag with `docker run` or define them in a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file.

  ```yaml
  environment:
    - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
    - API_KEY=your-api-key
  ```

#### Accessing Environment Variables in Clojure

In Clojure, environment variables can be accessed using the `System/getenv` function. Here's an example:

```clojure
(defn get-config []
  {:database-url (System/getenv "DATABASE_URL")
   :api-key (System/getenv "API_KEY")})

(def config (get-config))

(println "Database URL:" (:database-url config))
(println "API Key:" (:api-key config))
```

### Configuration Files

While environment variables are suitable for simple configurations, more complex applications may benefit from using configuration files. Configuration files can be written in various formats such as EDN, JSON, YAML, or even plain text.

#### Using EDN for Configuration

EDN (Extensible Data Notation) is a native format for Clojure, making it an excellent choice for configuration files. Here's an example of an EDN configuration file:

```edn
;; config.edn
{:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
 :api-key "your-api-key"
 :log-level :info}
```

To load and parse this file in Clojure, you can use the `clojure.edn/read-string` function along with `slurp`:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.edn :as edn])

(defn load-config [file-path]
  (edn/read-string (slurp file-path)))

(def config (load-config "config.edn"))

(println "Configuration:" config)
```

#### Using JSON or YAML

For teams that prefer JSON or YAML, Clojure provides libraries like `cheshire` for JSON and `clj-yaml` for YAML. Here's how you can load a JSON configuration file:

```clojure
(require '[cheshire.core :as json])

(defn load-json-config [file-path]
  (json/parse-string (slurp file-path) true))

(def config (load-json-config "config.json"))

(println "Configuration:" config)
```

### Tools for Configuration Management

Several libraries in the Clojure ecosystem facilitate configuration management, making it easier to handle environment variables and configuration files.

#### `env` Library

The `env` library provides a simple way to manage environment variables in Clojure applications. It allows you to define default values and types for your environment variables.

To use `env`, add it to your `project.clj` or `deps.edn`:

```clojure
;; project.clj
:dependencies [[environ "1.2.0"]]
```

Here's an example of how to use `env`:

```clojure
(require '[environ.core :refer [env]])

(def config
  {:database-url (env :database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/defaultdb")
   :api-key (env :api-key "default-api-key")
   :log-level (keyword (env :log-level "info"))})

(println "Configuration:" config)
```

#### `cprop` Library

The `cprop` library is another powerful tool for configuration management. It supports merging configurations from multiple sources, including environment variables, system properties, and configuration files.

To use `cprop`, add it to your `project.clj` or `deps.edn`:

```clojure
;; project.clj
:dependencies [[cprop "0.1.17"]]
```

Here's an example of how to use `cprop`:

```clojure
(require '[cprop.core :refer [load-config]])

(def config (load-config :merge
                         [(System/getenv)
                          (System/getProperties)
                          "config.edn"]))

(println "Configuration:" config)
```

### Best Practices for Configuration Management

1. **Keep Configuration Out of Code**: Avoid hardcoding configuration values in your application code. Use environment variables or configuration files instead.

2. **Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Data**: Store sensitive information like API keys and passwords in environment variables to keep them out of version control.

3. **Provide Default Values**: When using environment variables, provide sensible default values to ensure your application can run in different environments without manual intervention.

4. **Document Configuration Requirements**: Clearly document the required configuration variables and their expected values to assist developers and operators in setting up the application.

5. **Use a Consistent Format**: Choose a configuration format (e.g., EDN, JSON, YAML) that suits your team's needs and stick to it for consistency.

6. **Validate Configuration**: Implement validation logic to ensure that configuration values meet the expected criteria before using them in your application.

### Practical Example: Configuring a Web Application

Let's walk through a practical example of configuring a Clojure web application using the principles and tools discussed.

#### Step 1: Define Configuration Requirements

Suppose we have a web application that requires the following configuration:

- Database URL
- API Key
- Log Level
- Port Number

#### Step 2: Create a Configuration File

Create an EDN configuration file named `config.edn`:

```edn
;; config.edn
{:database-url "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb"
 :api-key "your-api-key"
 :log-level :info
 :port 3000}
```

#### Step 3: Load Configuration Using `cprop`

Use the `cprop` library to load the configuration, allowing overrides from environment variables:

```clojure
(require '[cprop.core :refer [load-config]])

(def config (load-config :merge
                         [(System/getenv)
                          "config.edn"]))

(println "Configuration:" config)
```

#### Step 4: Access Configuration in Your Application

Use the loaded configuration in your application code:

```clojure
(defn start-server []
  (let [{:keys [database-url api-key log-level port]} config]
    (println "Starting server with configuration:")
    (println "Database URL:" database-url)
    (println "API Key:" api-key)
    (println "Log Level:" log-level)
    (println "Port:" port)
    ;; Initialize and start the web server here
    ))

(start-server)
```

#### Step 5: Set Environment Variables for Deployment

When deploying the application, set the necessary environment variables to override the default values in `config.edn`:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="jdbc:postgresql://production-db:5432/proddb"
export API_KEY="production-api-key"
export LOG_LEVEL="warn"
export PORT=8080
```

### Conclusion

Externalizing configuration is a best practice that enhances the flexibility, security, and scalability of Clojure applications. By leveraging environment variables, configuration files, and tools like `env` and `cprop`, developers can build robust applications that adapt seamlessly to different environments. Adhering to the 12-factor app principles ensures that your application remains maintainable and easy to deploy across various stages of development and production.
