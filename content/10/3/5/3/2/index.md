## 11.3.2 Authentication and Authorization

In the realm of web development, ensuring that users are who they claim to be (authentication) and that they have permission to perform certain actions (authorization) are critical components of application security. In Clojure, these concerns can be elegantly managed using middleware, a concept that allows for the modular handling of HTTP requests and responses. This section will delve into implementing authentication and authorization in Clojure, leveraging middleware to handle user sessions, API tokens, and role-based access control.

### Understanding Middleware in Clojure

Middleware in Clojure, particularly in the context of web applications built with libraries like Ring, acts as a processing layer that wraps around your core application logic. Middleware functions take a handler (the core application logic) and return a new handler that adds additional behavior. This is particularly useful for cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and, of course, authentication and authorization.

### Implementing Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In web applications, this often involves checking credentials like usernames and passwords, or validating tokens such as API keys or JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).

#### Session-Based Authentication

Session-based authentication involves creating a session for a user after they log in, typically stored on the server side, with a session ID sent to the client as a cookie. Here's how you can implement session-based authentication using Ring middleware.

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware.auth
  (:require [ring.middleware.session :refer [wrap-session]]
            [ring.util.response :refer [response redirect]]))

(defn wrap-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [session (:session request)
          user (:user session)]
      (if user
        (handler request)
        (redirect "/login")))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-session)
      (wrap-authentication)))
```

In this example, `wrap-authentication` checks if a user is present in the session. If not, it redirects the user to a login page. This middleware can be composed with other middleware to form a complete application stack.

#### Token-Based Authentication

Token-based authentication is stateless and involves sending a token with each request, which the server validates. This approach is common in RESTful APIs.

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware.token-auth
  (:require [ring.util.response :refer [response status]]))

(defn valid-token? [token]
  ;; Implement your token validation logic here
  (= token "valid-token"))

(defn wrap-token-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [token (get-in request [:headers "authorization"])]
      (if (valid-token? token)
        (handler request)
        (-> (response "Unauthorized")
            (status 401))))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-token-authentication)))
```

Here, `wrap-token-authentication` checks for an `Authorization` header and validates the token. If the token is invalid, it returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

### Implementing Authorization

Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. This often involves checking user roles or permissions.

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned roles. Here's an example of implementing RBAC in Clojure middleware.

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware.authorization
  (:require [ring.util.response :refer [response status]]))

(def roles-permissions
  {:admin #{:read :write :delete}
   :user #{:read}})

(defn has-permission? [user role permission]
  (contains? (get roles-permissions role) permission))

(defn wrap-authorization [handler required-permission]
  (fn [request]
    (let [user (:user (:session request))
          role (:role user)]
      (if (has-permission? user role required-permission)
        (handler request)
        (-> (response "Forbidden")
            (status 403))))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-authorization :read)))
```

In this example, `wrap-authorization` checks if the user has the necessary permission to access a resource. If not, it returns a 403 Forbidden response.

### Combining Authentication and Authorization

In a real-world application, you would typically combine authentication and authorization middleware to ensure that only authenticated users with the appropriate permissions can access certain resources.

```clojure
(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-session)
      (wrap-authentication)
      (wrap-authorization :read)))
```

### Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Secure Token Storage**: Ensure tokens are stored securely on the client side, using mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or secure storage APIs.

2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, preventing token interception.

3. **Token Expiry and Revocation**: Implement token expiry and revocation mechanisms to enhance security.

4. **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs of authentication and authorization events to monitor and audit access.

5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and status codes, but avoid revealing sensitive information.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Storing Sensitive Data in Tokens**: Avoid storing sensitive information in tokens, especially if they are not encrypted.

- **Overlooking Token Expiry**: Ensure tokens have a reasonable expiry time to reduce the risk of misuse.

- **Ignoring Session Hijacking Risks**: Implement measures to prevent session hijacking, such as IP address checks and user-agent validation.

### Advanced Topics

#### JWT Authentication

JWTs are a popular choice for token-based authentication due to their compact size and ability to carry claims. Here's a basic example of JWT authentication middleware.

```clojure
(ns myapp.middleware.jwt-auth
  (:require [ring.util.response :refer [response status]]
            [buddy.sign.jwt :as jwt]))

(def secret "your-secret-key")

(defn valid-jwt? [token]
  (try
    (jwt/unsign token secret)
    true
    (catch Exception _ false)))

(defn wrap-jwt-authentication [handler]
  (fn [request]
    (let [token (get-in request [:headers "authorization"])]
      (if (and token (valid-jwt? token))
        (handler request)
        (-> (response "Unauthorized")
            (status 401))))))

(def app
  (-> handler
      (wrap-jwt-authentication)))
```

In this example, `buddy.sign.jwt` is used to validate JWTs. The middleware checks for a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header.

### Conclusion

Implementing authentication and authorization in Clojure using middleware offers a flexible and modular approach to securing web applications. By leveraging session and token-based authentication, along with role-based access control, developers can build robust security mechanisms tailored to their application's needs. As with any security implementation, it's crucial to follow best practices and remain vigilant against potential vulnerabilities.
