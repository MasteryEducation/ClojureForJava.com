## 10.3.2 Network IO and HTTP Requests

In the realm of modern software development, network communication is a cornerstone of building robust applications. Whether you're fetching data from a REST API, submitting forms, or integrating with third-party services, understanding how to perform network IO and handle HTTP requests is crucial. In this section, we'll delve into the world of HTTP requests in Clojure, focusing on practical implementations using popular libraries like `clj-http` and `http-kit`.

### Understanding HTTP in Clojure

Before diving into code, it's important to grasp the basics of HTTP. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It operates as a request-response protocol between a client and server. Common HTTP methods include:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create or update a resource.
- **PUT**: Update a resource on the server.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.

Clojure, being a functional language, offers elegant ways to handle HTTP requests and responses, emphasizing immutability and simplicity.

### Choosing the Right Library

Clojure provides several libraries for handling HTTP requests. Two of the most popular are:

- **clj-http**: A simple, idiomatic HTTP client for Clojure.
- **http-kit**: A lightweight, high-performance HTTP client and server library.

Both libraries have their strengths, and the choice often depends on specific project requirements. `clj-http` is known for its ease of use and rich feature set, while `http-kit` is favored for its non-blocking IO capabilities and performance.

### Making HTTP Requests with clj-http

#### Setting Up clj-http

To get started with `clj-http`, you'll need to add it to your project dependencies. If you're using Leiningen, include the following in your `project.clj`:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [clj-http "3.12.3"]])
```

#### Performing a GET Request

A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. Here's how you can perform a simple GET request using `clj-http`:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:require [clj-http.client :as client]))

(defn fetch-data []
  (let [response (client/get "https://api.example.com/data")]
    (println (:status response))
    (println (:body response))))
```

In this example, `client/get` sends a GET request to the specified URL. The response is a map containing keys like `:status` and `:body`, which represent the HTTP status code and the response body, respectively.

#### Handling Responses

Handling HTTP responses effectively is crucial for building reliable applications. Here's how you can process a JSON response:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:require [clj-http.client :as client]
            [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn fetch-json-data []
  (let [response (client/get "https://api.example.com/data" {:as :json})]
    (if (= 200 (:status response))
      (println "Data:" (json/parse-string (:body response) true))
      (println "Failed to fetch data" (:status response)))))
```

In this example, the `:as :json` option automatically parses the JSON response, making it easier to work with Clojure data structures.

#### Performing a POST Request

A POST request is used to send data to a server. Here's how you can perform a POST request with `clj-http`:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:require [clj-http.client :as client]
            [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn post-data []
  (let [response (client/post "https://api.example.com/submit"
                              {:headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}
                               :body (json/generate-string {:key "value"})})]
    (println (:status response))
    (println (:body response))))
```

In this example, we're sending JSON data to the server. The `:headers` option specifies the content type, while `:body` contains the JSON payload.

#### Error Handling Strategies

Error handling is an essential aspect of network programming. `clj-http` provides several options for handling errors:

- **Status Codes**: Check the `:status` key in the response map to determine if the request was successful.
- **Exceptions**: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions like `java.net.UnknownHostException`.

```clojure
(defn safe-fetch []
  (try
    (let [response (client/get "https://api.example.com/data")]
      (if (= 200 (:status response))
        (println "Success:" (:body response))
        (println "Error: Status" (:status response))))
    (catch Exception e
      (println "Exception occurred:" (.getMessage e)))))
```

### Making HTTP Requests with http-kit

#### Setting Up http-kit

To use `http-kit`, add it to your project dependencies:

```clojure
(defproject my-clojure-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [http-kit "2.5.3"]])
```

#### Performing a GET Request

`http-kit` offers a non-blocking approach to HTTP requests. Here's how you can perform a GET request:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:require [org.httpkit.client :as http]))

(defn fetch-data []
  (http/get "https://api.example.com/data"
            (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
              (if (= 200 status)
                (println "Data:" body)
                (println "Failed to fetch data" status)))))
```

In this example, `http/get` is used to send a GET request. The response is handled asynchronously using a callback function.

#### Performing a POST Request

Here's how you can perform a POST request using `http-kit`:

```clojure
(ns my-clojure-app.core
  (:require [org.httpkit.client :as http]
            [cheshire.core :as json]))

(defn post-data []
  (http/post "https://api.example.com/submit"
             {:headers {"Content-Type" "application/json"}
              :body (json/generate-string {:key "value"})}
             (fn [{:keys [status body]}]
               (if (= 200 status)
                 (println "Success:" body)
                 (println "Failed to post data" status)))))
```

The `http/post` function sends a POST request, and the response is processed in the callback.

#### Handling Errors

Error handling in `http-kit` is similar to `clj-http`. You can check the status code and use try-catch blocks for exceptions:

```clojure
(defn safe-fetch []
  (try
    (http/get "https://api.example.com/data"
              (fn [{:keys [status body error]}]
                (if error
                  (println "Error occurred:" error)
                  (println "Data:" body))))
    (catch Exception e
      (println "Exception occurred:" (.getMessage e)))))
```

### Comparing clj-http and http-kit

Both `clj-http` and `http-kit` are powerful tools for handling HTTP requests in Clojure. Here's a comparison to help you choose the right one for your project:

| Feature          | clj-http                        | http-kit                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
