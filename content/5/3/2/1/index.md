## 3.2.1 Single-Node Setup for Cassandra Development

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. For developers, setting up a single-node Cassandra instance on a local machine is an excellent way to get familiar with its capabilities and begin integrating it with Clojure applications. This section will guide you through the installation, configuration, and verification of a single-node Cassandra setup for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **Operating System**: This guide assumes you are using a Unix-based system (Linux or macOS). Windows users can follow similar steps using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Docker.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Cassandra requires Java 8 or later. Ensure that you have the JDK installed and configured on your machine.
- **Clojure Environment**: While not strictly necessary for setting up Cassandra, having a Clojure development environment ready will be beneficial for later integration.

### Step 1: Installing Cassandra

#### Downloading Cassandra

1. **Visit the Apache Cassandra website**: Go to the [Apache Cassandra download page](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) to get the latest stable release.

2. **Choose the appropriate version**: Download the binary tarball for your operating system. As of this writing, the latest stable version is Cassandra 4.0.

3. **Extract the tarball**: Once downloaded, extract the tarball to a directory of your choice. You can use the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf apache-cassandra-4.0-bin.tar.gz
   ```

#### Setting Up Environment Variables

To make Cassandra commands accessible from anywhere in your terminal, add the Cassandra `bin` directory to your system's PATH.

1. **Open your shell configuration file**: This could be `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`, depending on your shell.

2. **Add the following line**:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/apache-cassandra-4.0/bin
   ```

3. **Apply the changes**:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Step 2: Configuring Cassandra

Cassandra's configuration is primarily managed through the `cassandra.yaml` file located in the `conf` directory of your Cassandra installation. This file contains numerous parameters that control the behavior of your Cassandra instance.

#### Key Configuration Parameters

1. **Cluster Name**: Although you're setting up a single-node instance, it's good practice to set a unique cluster name.

   ```yaml
   cluster_name: 'MyCassandraCluster'
   ```

2. **Data Directories**: Specify directories for data, commit logs, and caches. Ensure these directories have the necessary permissions.

   ```yaml
   data_file_directories:
     - /var/lib/cassandra/data
   commitlog_directory: /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog
   saved_caches_directory: /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches
   ```

3. **Network Interfaces**: Configure the listen address and RPC address. For a local setup, these can be set to `localhost`.

   ```yaml
   listen_address: localhost
   rpc_address: localhost
   ```

4. **Seeds**: In a multi-node setup, seeds are used to bootstrap the gossip protocol. For a single-node setup, set the seed to `localhost`.

   ```yaml
   seed_provider:
     - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
       parameters:
         - seeds: "127.0.0.1"
   ```

5. **JVM Options**: Cassandra's performance can be tuned by adjusting JVM options in the `jvm.options` file. For development, the default settings are usually sufficient.

#### Best Practices for Configuration

- **Backup Configuration Files**: Always keep a backup of your original `cassandra.yaml` file before making changes.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the [official Cassandra documentation](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/configuration/cassandra_config_file.html) for detailed explanations of each parameter.

### Step 3: Starting Cassandra

With Cassandra installed and configured, you can now start the Cassandra service.

1. **Navigate to the Cassandra directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/apache-cassandra-4.0
   ```

2. **Start Cassandra**:

   ```bash
   bin/cassandra -f
   ```

   The `-f` flag runs Cassandra in the foreground, which is useful for development and debugging.

3. **Verify the Startup**: Check the logs in `logs/system.log` for any errors or warnings. A successful startup will end with a message indicating that the server is ready to accept client connections.

### Step 4: Verifying the Setup with cqlsh

Cassandra Query Language Shell (cqlsh) is an interactive command-line interface for executing CQL commands.

1. **Launch cqlsh**:

   ```bash
   bin/cqlsh
   ```

   If Cassandra is running correctly, you should see a prompt like this:

   ```
   Connected to MyCassandraCluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
   [cqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 4.0.0 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v4]
   Use HELP for help.
   cqlsh>
   ```

2. **Create a Keyspace**: Keyspaces are analogous to databases in relational systems.

   ```sql
   CREATE KEYSPACE test_keyspace WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
   ```

3. **Create a Table**:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test_keyspace.users (
       user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT,
       email TEXT
   );
   ```

4. **Insert Data**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO test_keyspace.users (user_id, name, email) VALUES (uuid(), 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
   ```

5. **Query Data**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM test_keyspace.users;
   ```

   This should return the data you just inserted, verifying that your Cassandra setup is functioning correctly.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure that the default Cassandra ports (9042 for CQL, 7000 for inter-node communication) are not being used by other applications.
- **Permissions**: Verify that the directories specified in `cassandra.yaml` have the correct permissions.
- **JVM Memory**: For larger datasets, you may need to adjust the JVM heap size in `jvm.options`.

### Integrating Cassandra with Clojure

With Cassandra up and running, you can now begin integrating it with your Clojure applications. Libraries such as [clojurewerkz/cassaforte](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/cassaforte) provide idiomatic Clojure interfaces for interacting with Cassandra.

#### Example: Connecting to Cassandra from Clojure

1. **Add Cassaforte to your project dependencies**:

   ```clojure
   [clojurewerkz/cassaforte "3.0.0"]
   ```

2. **Connect to Cassandra**:

   ```clojure
   (require '[qbits.alia :as alia])

   (def session (alia/connect {:contact-points ["127.0.0.1"]}))
   ```

3. **Execute Queries**:

   ```clojure
   (alia/execute session "SELECT * FROM test_keyspace.users")
   ```

### Conclusion

Setting up a single-node Cassandra instance on your local machine is a straightforward process that provides a solid foundation for developing and testing Clojure applications with Cassandra. By following this guide, you should now have a functioning Cassandra environment ready for further exploration and integration.

For more advanced configurations and optimizations, consider exploring multi-node clusters and Cassandra's extensive documentation on performance tuning and data modeling.
