## 3.4.2 Inserting Data into Cassandra with Clojure: Techniques and Best Practices

In this section, we will explore the intricacies of inserting data into Cassandra tables using CQL (Cassandra Query Language) from Clojure. As a Java developer transitioning to Clojure, you will find that Clojure's functional programming paradigm offers a unique and efficient way to interact with NoSQL databases like Cassandra. This chapter will guide you through the process of performing data insertions, leveraging batch operations, and understanding the impact of consistency levels on write operations.

### Understanding Cassandra's Data Model

Before diving into data insertion, it's crucial to understand Cassandra's data model. Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It uses a wide-column store model, which allows for flexible schema design and efficient data retrieval.

#### Key Concepts

- **Keyspace**: A namespace that defines data replication on nodes.
- **Table**: A collection of rows, each identified by a unique primary key.
- **Row**: A collection of columns identified by a primary key.
- **Column**: The smallest unit of data storage in Cassandra.

### Setting Up Your Clojure Environment

To interact with Cassandra from Clojure, you'll need a Clojure development environment set up with the necessary libraries. The most commonly used library for Cassandra in Clojure is [Cassaforte](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/cassaforte), which provides a Clojure-friendly API for interacting with Cassandra.

#### Installing Cassaforte

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

```clojure
(defproject your-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.3"]
                 [clojurewerkz/cassaforte "3.0.0"]])
```

### Basic Data Insertion with CQL

Cassandra's CQL provides a SQL-like syntax for interacting with the database. To insert data into a Cassandra table, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement.

#### Example: Inserting a Single Row

Let's assume you have a table `users` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  age INT
);
```

To insert a single row into this table using CQL, you would execute:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email, age) VALUES (uuid(), 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 30);
```

#### Inserting Data from Clojure

Using Cassaforte, you can perform the same operation from Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[qbits.alia :as alia])

(def cluster (alia/cluster {:contact-points ["127.0.0.1"]}))
(def session (alia/connect cluster))

(defn insert-user [session user-id name email age]
  (alia/execute session
                (alia/prepare "INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)")
                {:values [user-id name email age]}))

(insert-user session (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) "John Doe" "john.doe@example.com" 30)
```

### Batch Inserts for Performance

Batch inserts allow you to group multiple `INSERT` statements into a single operation, which can significantly improve performance by reducing the number of network round trips.

#### Example: Batch Insert

Suppose you want to insert multiple users at once:

```clojure
(defn batch-insert-users [session users]
  (alia/execute session
                (alia/batch
                  (map (fn [{:keys [user-id name email age]}]
                         (alia/prepare "INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)")
                         {:values [user-id name email age]})
                       users))))

(batch-insert-users session
                    [{:user-id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) :name "Alice" :email "alice@example.com" :age 28}
                     {:user-id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) :name "Bob" :email "bob@example.com" :age 34}])
```

### Prepared Statements for Efficiency

Prepared statements are pre-compiled SQL statements that can be executed multiple times with different parameters. They offer performance benefits by reducing the overhead of parsing and compiling the SQL statement on each execution.

#### Using Prepared Statements

In the previous examples, we used `alia/prepare` to create a prepared statement. This approach is efficient for repeated operations, such as inserting multiple rows with similar data.

### Consistency Levels and Write Operations

Consistency levels in Cassandra determine the number of replicas that must acknowledge a read or write operation before it is considered successful. This setting affects the trade-off between consistency and availability.

#### Common Consistency Levels

- **ONE**: Only one replica needs to acknowledge the write.
- **QUORUM**: A majority of replicas must acknowledge the write.
- **ALL**: All replicas must acknowledge the write.

#### Choosing the Right Consistency Level

The choice of consistency level depends on your application's requirements for consistency and availability. For example, using `QUORUM` ensures that a majority of replicas have the latest data, which is a good balance between consistency and availability.

#### Setting Consistency Levels in Clojure

You can specify the consistency level when executing a query with Cassaforte:

```clojure
(defn insert-user-with-consistency [session user-id name email age consistency-level]
  (alia/execute session
                (alia/prepare "INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)")
                {:values [user-id name email age]
                 :consistency consistency-level}))

(insert-user-with-consistency session (java.util.UUID/randomUUID) "Charlie" "charlie@example.com" 25 :quorum)
```

### Best Practices for Data Insertion

1. **Use Batch Inserts Wisely**: While batch inserts can improve performance, they should be used judiciously. Batching too many operations can lead to timeouts and increased latency.

2. **Leverage Prepared Statements**: Prepared statements reduce the overhead of query parsing and compilation, leading to faster execution times.

3. **Choose Appropriate Consistency Levels**: Balance consistency and availability based on your application's needs. Higher consistency levels provide stronger guarantees but may impact performance.

4. **Monitor and Optimize**: Regularly monitor the performance of your Cassandra cluster and optimize your queries and data model as needed.

### Conclusion

Inserting data into Cassandra from Clojure involves understanding the nuances of CQL, leveraging batch operations and prepared statements for performance, and carefully selecting consistency levels to meet your application's requirements. By following the best practices outlined in this chapter, you can ensure efficient and reliable data insertion in your Clojure applications.
