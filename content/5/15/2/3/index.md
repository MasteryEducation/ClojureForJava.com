## 15.2.3 Deploying Clojure Applications to AWS

As cloud computing continues to dominate the landscape of modern application deployment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands out as a leading provider, offering a plethora of services that cater to diverse deployment needs. For Clojure developers, AWS provides robust platforms to deploy applications, ranging from traditional server-based deployments to cutting-edge serverless architectures. This section delves into deploying Clojure applications on AWS using three primary methods: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Docker on AWS ECS/EKS, and AWS Lambda for serverless deployment.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment and management of applications in the cloud. It abstracts much of the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code. Elastic Beanstalk supports various languages, including Java, which makes it a suitable choice for deploying Clojure applications packaged as Java JAR files.

#### Packaging Your Clojure Application

Before deploying to Elastic Beanstalk, you need to package your Clojure application. This is typically done using Leiningen, a popular build automation tool for Clojure.

1. **Create an Uberjar:**
   Use the `lein uberjar` command to package your application into a standalone JAR file. This JAR will include all dependencies, making it easy to deploy.

   ```bash
   lein uberjar
   ```

   This command generates a JAR file in the `target` directory of your project.

#### Deploying to Elastic Beanstalk

Once your application is packaged, you can deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk.

1. **Create a New Environment:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk and create a new environment.
   - Choose the "Java" platform, as your Clojure application is packaged as a Java JAR.

2. **Upload Your JAR File:**
   - You can upload your JAR file through the Elastic Beanstalk console or use the AWS CLI.
   - If using the console, follow the prompts to upload your JAR and configure environment settings.

3. **Monitor and Manage:**
   - Elastic Beanstalk provides monitoring tools and easy scaling options. You can adjust instance sizes, configure load balancing, and set up auto-scaling based on your application's needs.

#### Best Practices for Elastic Beanstalk

- **Environment Configuration:** Utilize configuration files (`.ebextensions`) to automate environment settings and resource provisioning.
- **Monitoring:** Leverage AWS CloudWatch for monitoring application performance and setting up alerts.
- **Security:** Ensure your application is secure by configuring security groups and using IAM roles for resource access.

### Docker on AWS ECS/EKS

Containerization has revolutionized application deployment, offering consistency across environments and simplifying dependency management. AWS provides two primary services for deploying containerized applications: Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

#### Containerizing Your Clojure Application

To deploy your Clojure application using Docker, you first need to containerize it.

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image for your application.

   ```dockerfile
   # Use a base image with Java
   FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy the uberjar into the container
   COPY target/myapp-standalone.jar /app/myapp.jar

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   Use the Docker CLI to build an image from your Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp .
   ```

#### Deploying with Amazon ECS

Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.

1. **Define a Task Definition:**
   A task definition is a blueprint for your application, specifying the Docker image, CPU, memory, and networking settings.

   ```json
   {
     "family": "myapp",
     "containerDefinitions": [
       {
         "name": "myapp-container",
         "image": "myapp:latest",
         "memory": 512,
         "cpu": 256,
         "essential": true,
         "portMappings": [
           {
             "containerPort": 8080,
             "hostPort": 8080
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Service:**
   A service in ECS allows you to run and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition.

   ```bash
   aws ecs create-service --cluster my-cluster --service-name myapp-service --task-definition myapp
   ```

#### Deploying with Amazon EKS

Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane.

1. **Create a Kubernetes Deployment:**
   Define a deployment YAML file for your application.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: myapp
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: myapp
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: myapp
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: myapp
           image: myapp:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
   ```

2. **Apply the Deployment:**
   Use `kubectl` to apply the deployment configuration to your EKS cluster.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
   ```

#### Best Practices for ECS/EKS

- **Resource Management:** Use resource requests and limits to manage CPU and memory allocation effectively.
- **Networking:** Configure VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure secure and efficient networking.
- **Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling policies to handle varying loads.

### Serverless Deployment with AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, making it ideal for microservices and event-driven architectures.

#### Deploying Clojure Functions to Lambda

To deploy Clojure code to AWS Lambda, you can use frameworks like **apex** or **lambda-tools**. These tools help package and deploy your Clojure functions to Lambda.

1. **Write a Lambda Handler:**
   Your Clojure function must conform to AWS Lambda's handler requirements.

   ```clojure
   (ns myapp.handler)

   (defn handler [event context]
     ;; Your handler logic here
     {:statusCode 200 :body "Hello, World!"})
   ```

2. **Package Your Function:**
   Use a tool like `lein` to package your function and its dependencies.

   ```bash
   lein uberjar
   ```

3. **Deploy Using Apex:**
   Apex simplifies the deployment of Lambda functions written in languages other than Node.js.

   ```bash
   apex deploy
   ```

#### Best Practices for AWS Lambda

- **Cold Start Optimization:** Minimize cold start times by reducing the size of your deployment package and using provisioned concurrency.
- **Monitoring:** Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor function execution and set up alerts for failures or performance issues.
- **Security:** Use IAM roles to control access to AWS resources and ensure your functions are secure.

### Conclusion

Deploying Clojure applications on AWS offers flexibility and scalability, catering to various deployment needs. Whether using Elastic Beanstalk for simplicity, Docker with ECS/EKS for containerized applications, or AWS Lambda for serverless architectures, AWS provides the tools and services necessary to deploy and manage applications effectively. By understanding the nuances of each deployment method and adhering to best practices, Clojure developers can leverage AWS to build robust, scalable, and efficient applications.
