## 4.4.1 Creating and Updating Items in DynamoDB with Clojure

In this section, we will delve into the intricacies of creating and updating items in AWS DynamoDB using Clojure. As a Java developer transitioning to Clojure, you'll appreciate the functional programming paradigms and concise syntax that Clojure offers. We'll explore how to use the `put-item` operation to insert or replace items in a DynamoDB table and how to use condition expressions to prevent overwriting existing data. Additionally, we'll cover the `update-item` operation, including how to use expression syntax to modify attributes effectively.

### Introduction to DynamoDB and Clojure

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It is designed to handle large amounts of data across many servers, making it an ideal choice for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

Clojure, with its emphasis on immutability and functional programming, provides a powerful toolset for interacting with DynamoDB. The `amazonica` library is a popular choice for Clojure developers working with AWS services, offering a comprehensive and idiomatic Clojure interface to the AWS SDK.

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into the code, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to access DynamoDB.
2. **Clojure Development Environment**: Make sure you have Clojure and Leiningen installed. Refer to [Appendix A](#) for setup instructions.
3. **Amazonica Library**: Add the `amazonica` dependency to your `project.clj` file:

   ```clojure
   :dependencies [[amazonica "0.3.152"]]
   ```

4. **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

### Creating Items with `put-item`

The `put-item` operation in DynamoDB allows you to create a new item or replace an existing item with the same primary key. This operation is straightforward but powerful, as it can be used to insert complex nested data structures.

#### Basic `put-item` Example

Let's start with a basic example of inserting an item into a DynamoDB table. Assume we have a table named `Users` with a primary key `userId`.

```clojure
(ns myapp.dynamodb
  (:require [amazonica.aws.dynamodbv2 :as dynamodb]))

(defn put-user [user-id name email]
  (dynamodb/put-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :item {:userId {:s user-id}
           :name   {:s name}
           :email  {:s email}}))
```

In this example, we define a function `put-user` that takes a `user-id`, `name`, and `email` as arguments and inserts them into the `Users` table. The `:item` map specifies the attributes of the item, with each attribute represented as a map containing the data type (`:s` for string) and the value.

#### Using Condition Expressions

One of the powerful features of DynamoDB is the ability to use condition expressions to control how data is written. For example, you might want to prevent overwriting an existing user. You can achieve this by using a condition expression with the `put-item` operation.

```clojure
(defn put-user-if-not-exists [user-id name email]
  (dynamodb/put-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :item {:userId {:s user-id}
           :name   {:s name}
           :email  {:s email}}
    :condition-expression "attribute_not_exists(userId)"))
```

In this function, the `:condition-expression` parameter is used to specify that the `put-item` operation should only succeed if the `userId` attribute does not already exist. This prevents overwriting an existing user with the same `userId`.

### Updating Items with `update-item`

The `update-item` operation allows you to modify existing items in a DynamoDB table. This operation is more complex than `put-item` because it involves specifying update expressions to define how attributes should be modified.

#### Basic `update-item` Example

Let's consider a scenario where we want to update a user's email address. We can use the `update-item` operation to achieve this.

```clojure
(defn update-user-email [user-id new-email]
  (dynamodb/update-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :key {:userId {:s user-id}}
    :update-expression "SET email = :newEmail"
    :expression-attribute-values {":newEmail" {:s new-email}}))
```

In this example, we define a function `update-user-email` that takes a `user-id` and a `new-email` as arguments. The `:key` parameter specifies the primary key of the item to update. The `:update-expression` parameter defines the update operation, using the `SET` keyword to assign a new value to the `email` attribute. The `:expression-attribute-values` parameter provides the value for the `:newEmail` placeholder in the update expression.

#### Conditional Updates

Similar to `put-item`, the `update-item` operation supports condition expressions to ensure that updates are only applied under certain conditions. For example, you might want to update a user's email only if the current email matches a specific value.

```clojure
(defn update-user-email-if-matches [user-id current-email new-email]
  (dynamodb/update-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :key {:userId {:s user-id}}
    :update-expression "SET email = :newEmail"
    :condition-expression "email = :currentEmail"
    :expression-attribute-values {":newEmail" {:s new-email}
                                  ":currentEmail" {:s current-email}}))
```

In this function, the `:condition-expression` parameter is used to specify that the update should only proceed if the `email` attribute matches the `:currentEmail` value. This ensures that the email is only updated if it hasn't been changed by another process since it was last read.

### Advanced Update Expressions

DynamoDB's update expressions support a variety of operations, including adding or removing elements from lists, incrementing or decrementing numeric values, and deleting attributes. Let's explore some of these advanced operations.

#### Incrementing a Counter

Suppose you have a `loginCount` attribute that tracks the number of times a user has logged in. You can use the `ADD` operation to increment this counter.

```clojure
(defn increment-login-count [user-id]
  (dynamodb/update-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :key {:userId {:s user-id}}
    :update-expression "ADD loginCount :increment"
    :expression-attribute-values {":increment" {:n "1"}}))
```

In this example, the `ADD` operation is used to increment the `loginCount` attribute by 1. The `:expression-attribute-values` parameter provides the value for the `:increment` placeholder.

#### Removing an Attribute

To remove an attribute from an item, you can use the `REMOVE` operation. For example, you might want to remove a deprecated `nickname` attribute.

```clojure
(defn remove-nickname [user-id]
  (dynamodb/update-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :key {:userId {:s user-id}}
    :update-expression "REMOVE nickname"))
```

In this function, the `REMOVE` operation is used to delete the `nickname` attribute from the item.

#### Modifying Nested Attributes

DynamoDB supports nested attributes, allowing you to store complex data structures within a single item. You can use the `SET` operation to modify nested attributes.

```clojure
(defn update-user-address [user-id street city]
  (dynamodb/update-item
    :table-name "Users"
    :key {:userId {:s user-id}}
    :update-expression "SET address.street = :street, address.city = :city"
    :expression-attribute-values {":street" {:s street}
                                  ":city" {:s city}}))
```

In this example, the `SET` operation is used to update the `street` and `city` attributes within the `address` map.

### Best Practices and Optimization Tips

When working with DynamoDB, it's important to follow best practices to ensure optimal performance and data integrity.

1. **Use Condition Expressions**: Always use condition expressions to prevent unintended overwrites and ensure data consistency.

2. **Batch Operations**: For high-throughput applications, consider using batch operations to reduce the number of network round trips.

3. **Indexing**: Use secondary indexes to enable efficient querying of non-primary key attributes.

4. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor your table's read and write capacity usage to avoid throttling and optimize cost.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage transient errors and retries.
