## 2.6.3 Implementing Full-Text Search with MongoDB and Clojure

In today's data-driven world, the ability to efficiently search through vast amounts of text data is crucial for many applications. Full-text search allows users to query large datasets quickly and find relevant information based on textual content. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, provides built-in support for full-text search capabilities, which can be seamlessly integrated with Clojure applications.

In this section, we will explore how to implement full-text search using MongoDB and Clojure. We will cover the following topics:

1. Enabling MongoDB's text search capabilities by creating text indexes.
2. Performing text searches and handling search results.
3. Optimizing indexes for search performance and relevance scoring.

By the end of this section, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage MongoDB's full-text search features in your Clojure applications, enabling you to build powerful and efficient search functionalities.

### Enabling MongoDB's Text Search Capabilities

MongoDB provides a powerful text search feature that allows you to perform searches on string content within your documents. To enable text search, you need to create text indexes on the fields you want to search. Text indexes are special indexes that store information about the words present in the indexed fields, allowing for efficient text search operations.

#### Creating Text Indexes

To create a text index in MongoDB, you use the `createIndex` method with the `text` option. Let's consider a simple example where we have a collection named `articles` with documents containing fields such as `title`, `content`, and `tags`. We want to enable text search on the `title` and `content` fields.

Here's how you can create a text index on these fields using the MongoDB shell:

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex(
  {
    title: "text",
    content: "text"
  },
  {
    name: "TextIndex"
  }
)
```

In this example, we specify the fields `title` and `content` as text fields in the index. The `name` option allows us to assign a custom name to the index for easier identification.

#### Creating Text Indexes with Clojure

To create text indexes in MongoDB using Clojure, we can use the Monger library, which provides a Clojure-friendly API for interacting with MongoDB. Here's how you can create a text index using Monger:

```clojure
(ns myapp.db
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]))

(defn create-text-index []
  (let [conn (mg/connect)
        db (mg/get-db conn "mydatabase")]
    (mc/create-index db "articles" {:title "text" :content "text"} {:name "TextIndex"})))
```

In this code snippet, we establish a connection to the MongoDB database using Monger, and then create a text index on the `articles` collection for the `title` and `content` fields.

### Performing Text Searches

Once you have created text indexes, you can perform text searches on the indexed fields using the `$text` query operator. The `$text` operator allows you to search for documents that match a given text search string.

#### Performing Text Searches with MongoDB Shell

Let's perform a text search on the `articles` collection to find documents that contain the word "Clojure" in the `title` or `content` fields:

```javascript
db.articles.find(
  {
    $text: {
      $search: "Clojure"
    }
  }
)
```

This query will return all documents where the word "Clojure" appears in the `title` or `content` fields.

#### Performing Text Searches with Clojure

To perform text searches in MongoDB using Clojure, we can use the Monger library. Here's how you can perform a text search using Monger:

```clojure
(ns myapp.search
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]))

(defn search-articles [search-term]
  (let [conn (mg/connect)
        db (mg/get-db conn "mydatabase")]
    (mc/find-maps db "articles" {$text {$search search-term}})))
```

In this code snippet, we define a function `search-articles` that takes a search term as an argument and performs a text search on the `articles` collection using the `$text` query operator.

### Handling Search Results

When performing text searches, MongoDB returns documents that match the search criteria. However, it's important to handle search results effectively to provide a good user experience.

#### Sorting Search Results by Relevance

By default, MongoDB sorts text search results by relevance score, which indicates how well a document matches the search criteria. The relevance score is calculated based on factors such as term frequency and inverse document frequency.

To sort search results by relevance in the MongoDB shell, you can use the `$meta` operator:

```javascript
db.articles.find(
  {
    $text: {
      $search: "Clojure"
    }
  },
  {
    score: { $meta: "textScore" }
  }
).sort({ score: { $meta: "textScore" } })
```

In this query, we include the `score` field in the projection to retrieve the relevance score for each document, and then sort the results by the `score` field.

#### Sorting Search Results by Relevance with Clojure

To sort search results by relevance in Clojure using Monger, you can use the `sort` function with the `$meta` operator:

```clojure
(ns myapp.search
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]))

(defn search-articles [search-term]
  (let [conn (mg/connect)
        db (mg/get-db conn "mydatabase")]
    (mc/find-maps db "articles"
                  {$text {$search search-term}}
                  {:fields {:score {$meta "textScore"}}}
                  :sort {:score {$meta "textScore"}})))
```

In this code snippet, we use the `:fields` option to include the `score` field in the projection and the `:sort` option to sort the results by the `score` field.

### Optimizing Indexes for Search Performance

Optimizing text indexes is crucial for achieving fast and efficient search performance. Here are some strategies to optimize text indexes in MongoDB:

#### 1. Index Only Necessary Fields

When creating text indexes, it's important to index only the fields that are necessary for your search requirements. Indexing unnecessary fields can increase the index size and impact performance.

#### 2. Use Compound Indexes

If your application requires filtering documents based on additional criteria besides text search, consider using compound indexes. Compound indexes allow you to combine text indexes with other fields, enabling efficient filtering and sorting.

For example, if you want to filter articles by category in addition to performing text search, you can create a compound index:

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex(
  {
    category: 1,
    title: "text",
    content: "text"
  }
)
```

In this example, we create a compound index on the `category`, `title`, and `content` fields.

#### 3. Monitor Index Usage

MongoDB provides tools to monitor index usage and identify unused indexes. Use the `db.collection.getIndexes()` method to list all indexes on a collection and the `db.collection.stats()` method to view index usage statistics.

#### 4. Regularly Rebuild Indexes

Over time, indexes can become fragmented, leading to decreased performance. Regularly rebuilding indexes can help maintain optimal performance. Use the `db.collection.reIndex()` method to rebuild indexes on a collection.

### Relevance Scoring and Search Optimization

Relevance scoring is a critical aspect of full-text search, as it determines the order in which search results are presented to users. MongoDB calculates relevance scores based on several factors, including term frequency and inverse document frequency.

#### Understanding Relevance Scoring

Relevance scoring in MongoDB is influenced by the following factors:

- **Term Frequency (TF):** The number of times a search term appears in a document. Higher term frequency increases the relevance score.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** A measure of how common or rare a search term is across all documents. Rare terms have higher IDF values, increasing the relevance score.
- **Field Weighting:** The importance of a field in the index. You can assign different weights to fields to influence the relevance score.

#### Adjusting Field Weights

You can adjust the weights of fields in a text index to influence the relevance score. For example, if you want to give more importance to the `title` field compared to the `content` field, you can specify field weights when creating the index:

```javascript
db.articles.createIndex(
  {
    title: "text",
    content: "text"
  },
  {
    weights: {
      title: 2,
      content: 1
    }
  }
)
```

In this example, the `title` field is given twice the weight of the `content` field, making it more influential in the relevance score calculation.

### Conclusion
