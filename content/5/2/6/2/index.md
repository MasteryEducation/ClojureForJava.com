## 2.6.2 Implementing CRUD Operations for the Blog

In this section, we will delve into implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a blog platform using Clojure and MongoDB. This will involve creating new blog posts and comments, retrieving posts with their comments, updating content, and deleting entries. We'll emphasize error handling and input validation to maintain data integrity throughout the process.

### Setting Up the Environment

Before we begin coding, ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine. You can download MongoDB from [MongoDB's official website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). Additionally, make sure your Clojure development environment is set up with Leiningen, as detailed in Appendix A of this book.

### Creating a Blog Post

Let's start by defining the data model for our blog post. In MongoDB, we'll use a collection named `posts` to store our blog entries. Each post will have a title, content, author, and a list of comments.

#### Defining the Data Model

In Clojure, we can represent a blog post using a simple map:

```clojure
(defn create-post [title content author]
  {:title title
   :content content
   :author author
   :comments []})
```

#### Inserting a New Post

To insert a new post into MongoDB, we'll use the Monger library. First, add Monger to your `project.clj` dependencies:

```clojure
:dependencies [[com.novemberain/monger "3.5.0"]]
```

Now, let's write a function to insert a new post:

```clojure
(ns blog.core
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]))

(defn insert-post [db post]
  (mc/insert db "posts" post))

(defn create-and-insert-post [db title content author]
  (let [post (create-post title content author)]
    (insert-post db post)))
```

#### Error Handling and Validation

Before inserting a post, it's crucial to validate the input to ensure data integrity. We can use `clojure.spec` for this purpose:

```clojure
(ns blog.validation
  (:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))

(s/def ::title (s/and string? #(not (empty? %))))
(s/def ::content (s/and string? #(not (empty? %))))
(s/def ::author (s/and string? #(not (empty? %))))

(s/def ::post (s/keys :req [::title ::content ::author]))

(defn validate-post [post]
  (if (s/valid? ::post post)
    post
    (throw (ex-info "Invalid post data" (s/explain-data ::post post)))))
```

Integrate validation into the insertion process:

```clojure
(defn create-and-insert-post [db title content author]
  (let [post (create-post title content author)]
    (validate-post post)
    (insert-post db post)))
```

### Retrieving Posts with Comments

To retrieve posts along with their comments, we can query the `posts` collection:

```clojure
(defn get-all-posts [db]
  (mc/find-maps db "posts"))
```

For a specific post by title:

```clojure
(defn get-post-by-title [db title]
  (mc/find-one-as-map db "posts" {:title title}))
```

### Adding Comments to a Post

Comments are stored as a list within each post document. To add a comment, we need to update the post document:

```clojure
(defn add-comment [db post-title comment]
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$push {:comments comment}}))
```

#### Comment Validation

Similar to posts, comments should be validated:

```clojure
(s/def ::comment (s/and string? #(not (empty? %))))

(defn validate-comment [comment]
  (if (s/valid? ::comment comment)
    comment
    (throw (ex-info "Invalid comment data" (s/explain-data ::comment comment)))))
```

Integrate validation:

```clojure
(defn add-comment [db post-title comment]
  (validate-comment comment)
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$push {:comments comment}}))
```

### Updating a Post

Updating a post involves modifying its content or title. Here's how you can update a post's content:

```clojure
(defn update-post-content [db post-title new-content]
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$set {:content new-content}}))
```

Ensure the new content is validated:

```clojure
(defn update-post-content [db post-title new-content]
  (validate-post {:title post-title :content new-content :author "dummy"})
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$set {:content new-content}}))
```

### Deleting a Post

To delete a post, simply remove it from the collection:

```clojure
(defn delete-post [db post-title]
  (mc/remove db "posts" {:title post-title}))
```

### Comprehensive Example

Let's put it all together in a comprehensive example:

```clojure
(ns blog.core
  (:require [monger.core :as mg]
            [monger.collection :as mc]
            [blog.validation :refer [validate-post validate-comment]]))

(defn create-post [title content author]
  {:title title
   :content content
   :author author
   :comments []})

(defn insert-post [db post]
  (mc/insert db "posts" post))

(defn create-and-insert-post [db title content author]
  (let [post (create-post title content author)]
    (validate-post post)
    (insert-post db post)))

(defn get-all-posts [db]
  (mc/find-maps db "posts"))

(defn get-post-by-title [db title]
  (mc/find-one-as-map db "posts" {:title title}))

(defn add-comment [db post-title comment]
  (validate-comment comment)
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$push {:comments comment}}))

(defn update-post-content [db post-title new-content]
  (validate-post {:title post-title :content new-content :author "dummy"})
  (mc/update db "posts" {:title post-title}
             {$set {:content new-content}}))

(defn delete-post [db post-title]
  (mc/remove db "posts" {:title post-title}))

(defn -main []
  (let [conn (mg/connect)
        db (mg/get-db conn "blog")]
    (create-and-insert-post db "My First Post" "This is the content of my first post." "Author Name")
    (add-comment db "My First Post" "This is a comment.")
    (println (get-all-posts db))
    (update-post-content db "My First Post" "Updated content.")
    (delete-post db "My First Post")))
```

### Error Handling and Best Practices

- **Error Handling:** Use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions during database operations. Log errors for debugging purposes.
- **Input Validation:** Always validate user inputs to prevent invalid data from being stored.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that updates and deletions maintain the integrity of related data.

### Conclusion

Implementing CRUD operations for a blog platform using Clojure and MongoDB involves understanding the data model, performing database operations, and ensuring data integrity through validation and error handling. By following the practices outlined in this section, you can build a robust and scalable blog application.
