## 8.2.2 Practical Examples of Complex Queries

In this section, we delve into the practical aspects of executing complex queries using Clojure with NoSQL databases. As data grows in complexity and volume, the ability to perform sophisticated queries efficiently becomes crucial. We will explore common tasks such as grouping data, calculating sums and averages, handling nested documents and arrays, and optimizing aggregation pipelines. This guide is designed for Java developers transitioning to Clojure, providing detailed examples and insights into leveraging Clojure's functional programming paradigm to interact with NoSQL databases effectively.

### Understanding NoSQL Query Mechanisms

NoSQL databases, unlike traditional SQL databases, offer diverse query mechanisms tailored to their specific data models. For instance, MongoDB uses a document-based model with a powerful aggregation framework, while Cassandra employs a wide-column store model with CQL (Cassandra Query Language). Understanding these mechanisms is essential for crafting efficient queries.

#### MongoDB Aggregation Framework

MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for data processing and transformation. It allows for operations such as filtering, grouping, and sorting data, similar to SQL's `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses, but with greater flexibility.

##### Example: Grouping and Calculating Averages

Suppose we have a collection of sales data, and we want to calculate the average sales amount per product category. Here's how you can achieve this using MongoDB's aggregation framework with Clojure:

```clojure
(require '[monger.core :as mg]
         '[monger.collection :as mc]
         '[monger.operators :refer :all])

(defn average-sales-per-category []
  (mg/connect!)
  (mg/set-db! (mg/get-db "salesdb"))
  (mc/aggregate "sales"
                [{$group {:_id "$category"
                          :averageSales {$avg "$amount"}}}]))
```

In this example, we connect to the MongoDB database `salesdb` and perform an aggregation on the `sales` collection. The `$group` stage groups documents by the `category` field and calculates the average sales amount using the `$avg` operator.

##### Handling Nested Documents and Arrays

MongoDB documents can contain nested structures and arrays, which require special handling in queries. Consider a scenario where each sales document includes an array of items, and we need to calculate the total quantity sold for each item across all sales.

```clojure
(mc/aggregate "sales"
              [{$unwind "$items"}
               {$group {:_id "$items.name"
                        :totalQuantity {$sum "$items.quantity"}}}])
```

Here, the `$unwind` stage deconstructs the `items` array, creating a separate document for each item. The `$group` stage then aggregates these documents by item name, summing the `quantity` field to get the total quantity sold.

### Optimizing Aggregation Pipelines

Optimization is key to ensuring that complex queries perform efficiently, especially as data volumes grow. Here are some tips for optimizing MongoDB aggregation pipelines:

1. **Use Indexes Wisely**: Ensure that fields used in `$match` and `$sort` stages are indexed to improve query performance.
2. **Limit Data Early**: Use `$match` and `$project` stages early in the pipeline to reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent stages.
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Stages**: Keep the pipeline as short as possible by eliminating redundant stages.
4. **Monitor and Analyze**: Use MongoDB's explain functionality to analyze query execution plans and identify bottlenecks.

### Complex Queries in Cassandra

Cassandra, with its wide-column store model, requires a different approach to complex queries. CQL provides a SQL-like syntax for querying data, but with some limitations due to Cassandra's distributed nature.

#### Example: Time-Series Data Aggregation

Consider a scenario where we have a time-series dataset of sensor readings, and we want to calculate the average reading per hour.

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
       AVG(reading) AS average_reading
FROM sensor_data
GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', timestamp);
```

In Clojure, you can execute this query using a CQL client library like [Cassandra Java Driver](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/).

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.jdbc :as jdbc])

(def db-spec {:classname "com.datastax.oss.driver.api.core.CqlSession"
              :subprotocol "cassandra"
              :subname "//localhost:9042/sensordb"})

(defn average-reading-per-hour []
  (jdbc/query db-spec
              ["SELECT date_trunc('hour', timestamp) AS hour,
                       AVG(reading) AS average_reading
                FROM sensor_data
                GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', timestamp)"]))
```

### Handling Nested Data Structures

Cassandra does not natively support nested data structures like MongoDB, but you can use collections such as lists, sets, and maps to store complex data. Querying these structures requires understanding CQL's collection operations.

#### Example: Querying Collections

Suppose we have a table storing user profiles with a set of interests, and we want to find users interested in "Clojure".

```sql
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE interests CONTAINS 'Clojure';
```

In Clojure, this can be executed as follows:

```clojure
(defn find-users-with-interest [interest]
  (jdbc/query db-spec
              ["SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE interests CONTAINS ?" interest]))
```

### Best Practices for Complex Queries

1. **Understand the Data Model**: Tailor your queries to the specific data model of the NoSQL database you are using.
2. **Optimize for Read or Write**: Depending on your application's needs, optimize queries for either read or write performance.
3. **Use Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on the database for frequently accessed data.
4. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor query performance and adjust indexes and queries as needed.

### Conclusion

Crafting complex queries in NoSQL databases using Clojure requires a deep understanding of both the database's capabilities and Clojure's functional programming paradigm. By leveraging the strengths of each, you can build scalable and efficient data solutions. Whether you're aggregating data, handling nested structures, or optimizing query performance, the examples and best practices outlined in this section will serve as a valuable resource.
